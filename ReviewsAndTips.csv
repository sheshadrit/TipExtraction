"Gastroteca is great new edition restaurant in Astoria. The have outside seating for great spring/ summer days and offer a great list of cocktail you simply can't beat. There pasta game is great and the brunch here is A1, but then again everything on their menu is good.I love the ambience in this place. The drinks are great, the staff is very helpful, & the food is amazing!Really great pasta dishes, appetizers and their drinks are great. The chicken and waffles for brunch here is one of the best by far i've had.Great neighborhood gem, brunch lunch or dinner is awesome. It Can be a bit noisy at times inside when busy, but thats every where with great food. I definitely recommend getting outside seatings in spring/summer timeGreat staple for weekend brunch & dog friendly. Great service!"," Gastroteca is great new edition restaurant in Astoria.

"We came here on Sunday around 1:45pm. It was kind of busy, but there were available seats inside and out. Unfortunately, the menu was limited. They didn't have crostinos and other stuff on the menu that were listed on their website menu. They also do not have wifi for customers.I ordered crispy gnocchi for $16. It consists of spinach, pistachio pesto, and ricotta salata. Unfortunately, I got so little on my plate. It literally took me about 5 mins to eat everything on my plate. Not worth $16. My other friend created her own brunch meal: wheat toast, two scrambled eggs, and home fries. My other friend ordered smoked atlantic salmon crostino for $14.50. Their meals were not small like mine. Pros: free coffee refills, clean restrooms, clean restaurant, outdoor seating available, and decent serviceDo not order crispy gnocchi if you're hungry. I would come back to try their eggs benedict next time."," My other friend created her own brunch meal: wheat toast, two scrambled eggs, and home fries.

"4 stars for the ambience/decor/waiters/their spinach gnocchi.. actually everything. It's just a block away from where I live and I am proud of having such a place in my neighborhood. U get great dinner , breakfast & brunch.and I like how a Black&white movie runs in the background- perfect setup for a date too.Food is great as well but it could be better and healthier ."," U get great dinner , breakfast & brunch.and I like how a Black&white movie runs in the background- perfect setup for a date too.Food is great as well but it could be better and healthier ."
This is indeed an outstanding brunch place. Everything is good! We ordered the famous banana ricotta which is perfect wth my coffee. I also had the salmon which is great. Have no complaints. Worth a second visit! Staff is very courteous., Everything is good! Have no complaints Worth a second visit Staff is very courteous.
"This is a random choice for tuesday brunch. We called before we get there & ask if they have table for 2. A person put us on hold for so long & we hang up but shes really nice that she called me back & told me theirs available tables inside. Got there & change our table to seat outside. We got seated on the corner of this restaurant. We called one of their waitress & inform her we're ready to order, she said shes gonna call our waitress but then shes still the one who came back & took our order. To start I got mimosa. For food my bf got the chicken sandwich & I got the sphagetti carbonara. They served the food real fast. My food was alright. It is topped with egg. My bf didn't like his sandwich, he said it taste like the tyson's chicken or chicken that we just microwave at home & it supposed to have avocado on it but theirs no avocado. We ask the waitress about it & she said shes gonna check about it & she never came back. So we called another waitress & ask for menu so we can double check the sandwich. The only time the waitress came back is when we ask our check. So we figured out that theirs 2 chicken sandwich in the menu (chicken sandwich & chicken cutlet & pesto sandwich) so she serves us pesto sandwich. Its weird because the pesto is more expensive than the other one with avocado & we ask for chicken sandwich. Sorry but we didn't enjoy our meal. No one check up on us and ask if we need anything and its so hard to catch their attention.", We got seated on the corner of this restaurant It is topped with egg So we called another waitress & ask for menu so we can double check the sandwich.

"Great ambience, nice waitress, delicious food, but kinda slow service. It's fine if you come in a group and you have a lot to chat to kill the wait time. We waited for almost 10 mins to order and another 15 mins or more for our food to come (restaurant was indeed pretty packed). Yet drinks were served fairly quickly (before ordering food).My friends got Scampi and Grits ($16) and Chicken and Waffle ($18) with 2 fried eggs and home fries. I ordered the Fried Eggplants and Burrata Sandwich ($13.5) with salad (can choose fries too). I tried a bit of my friends' dishes and I loved all of them, including mine! -- The polenta was so creamy and buttery, and the scampi was so chewy; the tomato sauce (I guess) was so delicious that had the perfect sourness and went so well with the scampi. -- The mascarpone cheese was sweet but not too thick, although the fried chicken was okay. -- My sandwich was really good! The fried eggplants had a thin crust, a bit dry, but the eggplants were very moist and watery, and the burrata was simply tasty and refreshing, which added moisture to the bread. The bread was crunchy/crispy outside, but doughy inside. With the moisture given from the eggplants and burrata cheese, you wouldn't feel very dry or hard to swallow. My iced coffee was not rich at all, though, too plain and watery. Anyway, we all agree that this is the type of place we want to come again."," -- The polenta was so creamy and buttery, and the scampi was so chewy; the tomato sauce (I guess) was so delicious that had the perfect sourness and went so well with the scampi. -- The mascarpone cheese was sweet but not too thick, although the fried chicken was okay. -- My sandwich was really good!

"Perfection. My crostini with smoked salmon (and ricotta and this insane spicy jam/compote and perfect sunny side eggs) was probably the best thing I've ordered in a very long time!!! It was SO GOOD. Thick country bread, spread with fresh ricotta (it's usually mixed with fresh dill but I asked for it without since I haaaaaate dill), a dash of spicy compote (I think it had olives?), slices of smoked Atlantic salmon, and 2 sunny side eggs. YUM. Flavor explosion in my mouth!I also opted for the side salad which was fresh arugula and radicchio tossed in a fresh vinegary dressing - I could NOT stop eating that!! My entire plate was FANTASTIC. Husband ordered the Italian Benedict which he LOVED - it had parmacotto (cooked prosciutto - MEATY and DELICIOUS), and we were amazed that we had never had this before!! We shared the zeppoles to end our meal - we were so full we couldn't eat more than 2 a piece. The service was excellent, the coffee was excellent, and our dishes were OUTSTANDING. It was so good we literally made reservations for the weekend after for brunch while paying our check! Cannot wait to come back here!"," My crostini with smoked salmon (and ricotta and this insane spicy jam/compote and perfect sunny side eggs) was probably the best thing I've ordered in a very long time!!!

"We came in for Sunday brunch around 11AM and surprisingly, it wasn't too packed. It's quite a picturesque little restaurant, the floor to ceiling windows and outdoor seating shaded with greenery add to its charm.I ordered the Smoked Atlantic Salmon Crostini with sunny side up eggs and a side salad. It's a simple plate and they let the ingredients speak for themselves - SO refreshing and delicious! It was a little difficult to eat as the crostini is a huge slice of bread, would have been better for them to cut it up into two portions perhaps. But nonetheless, I can appreciate generous quantities of food. My friend ordered the crispy gnocchi and THIS..... this was wow. It's already great texture-wise, initially crunchy and then chewy on the inside. Then you add the pesto sauce and shaved ricotta and it's a done deal. The portion looks small at first but it fills you up fast. I couldn't help myself from stealing some off her plate. The only complaint we have was for the mimosas. Their servings are quite small for the price and ours tasted watered down. Otherwise, the food was spot on - would definitely come back for more!"," It was a little difficult to eat as the crostini is a huge slice of bread, would have been better for them to cut it up into two portions perhaps.

"I came by with two friends on a Saturday around 12:00 PM and thankfully did not have to wait for a table.  We ordered the following:Smoked Atlantic Salmon Crostino ($13.50): the salmon came on a huge toast but I thought the toast was a bit too hard to chew.Belgian Waffles ($12.00): banana caramel sauce, walnut, and whipped cream on top of a huge waffle!  The waffle tasted really distinct (but good) and it was soft but a bit crunchy at the same time.  I really liked it!Scampi & Grits ($14.00): my friend ordered this and she thought it was good!The portions of the food were a bit above average!  None of us could finish our dish.  Service here was a bit slow... it took them a little over 30 mins to serve our food after ordering!  Our waitress also came by a little too often to check on our table - and it really seemed like she was rushing us... we felt a bit uncomfortable.Overall, a very average brunch spot."," We ordered the following:Smoked Atlantic Salmon Crostino ($13.50): the salmon came on a huge toast but I thought the toast was a bit too hard to chew.Belgian Waffles ($12.00): banana caramel sauce, walnut, and whipped cream on top of a huge waffle!

"I came in for brunch on a Sunday around 1:45pm and this place was packed. They had an ample amount of outside seating as well as tables and high tops but every table was full. Thankfully we were seated rather quickly as we were a group of 2. I had the California Benedict with potatoes and my friend had the burger with fries. The California Benedict comes with two poached eggs sitting atop  mashed avocado and two mini tomatoes on small ciabatta rolls. The size of my dish took me by surprise. It looked more like a finger food than an actual breakfast dish. If you're hungry then this dish prob won't fulfill your appetite. They gave a decent amount of potatoes but I was still left a little hungry after. I will say that the eggs were poached perfectly and although the dish was rather small it was still quite tasty! My friend's burger, however, was much larger in size. The patty was bigger than the bun which is a plus in my book. And she had plenty of fries. She wasn't even able to finish her entire burger and she was starving when we arrived. So the dish size varies a lot per dish here. Our waiter was attentive and quick with servicing us with a full water vase when we finished ours. Overall a decent experience here.", The California Benedict comes with two poached eggs sitting atop  mashed avocado and two mini tomatoes on small ciabatta rolls.

Also enjoyed the shaved brussels sprouts salad, fried calamari, crispy pesto gnocchi, and a perfect salmon (w/ clams, broccoli rabe, gnocchi) entree. Great service, to boot.", Had an excellent rehearsal dinner here recently The lamb ribs appetizer was exceptional. enjoy
"Brunch here is on point! Absolutely loved the Zeppoles with Nutella syrup to start.  The Chef makes an amazing Italian Fried Chicken & Waffles with agro dolce + mascarpone butter.  The chicken is big in portion and perfectly crispy! The waffle tasted different from other places. Couldn't tell what was different but we liked it. They brought over this home made balsamic maple syrup to the table and it complements the chicken really well. Also ordered the Brunch Lasagna with bacon, sausage, bechamel, mozzarella, spinach with a fried egg on top!  What a nice way to make a classic dinner dish into breakfast. We enjoyed our food here. Will go back again to try other dishes.", Absolutely loved the Zeppoles with Nutella syrup to start The waffle tasted different from other places.

"Came here on a Saturday @ 11:45 we were seated but told we had until 1 to eat. It is better if you make a reservation. It fills up quickly here.Good brunch menu, I wanted to try crostinos-they are only served during dinner but I was still happy with my dish. I got Scampi and grits - it was delicious with generous portions my bf had eggplant burrata sandwich plate with fries- sandwich wasn't filled at all 80% bread with 1 slice of eggplant. We also got eggs California  Benedict which was ridiculously tiny-literally 4 bites, the portions are definitely skewed depending on what you get so beware.Service was good no complaints there and the Place is spacious well lit. Might come back sometime."," It is better if you make a reservation It fills up quickly here.Good brunch menu, I wanted to try crostinos-they are only served during dinner but I was still happy with my dish.

"I came here yesterday with my gf for my birthday brunch and I was satisfy with my meal.  Food wise: I order The steak (medium well) and eggs (over easy) with a side order of smoked bacon and everything was cooked to perfection. The steak was juicy and tender just how I like it. Also the Belgium waffle my gf order was fluffy and tasty I can't go more into details because she didn't want to give me half hahaha, but from what I tasted it worth the purchase if you are into waffle. It is a decent size for the price. Resturant wise: Furthermore, the atmosphere of the place was welcoming; the staff was polite and very attentive. I been to other restaurants that they would just sit you take your order and that about it. However,  in this restaurants they care about the costumer and check up on you to see if everything is to your liking. If you are looking for a weekend brunch date I recommend this restaurant. P.S. If you are a foodie and love to take pics then this restaurant is also for you lol. Natural lighting all around so go nuts :)"," Also the Belgium waffle my gf order was fluffy and tasty I can't go more into details because she didn't want to give me half hahaha, but from what I tasted it worth the purchase if you are into waffle.

"We didn't have a reservation (It was a Saturday afternoon) but they were able to seat us at the bar. Bartender was there, but not very attentive. The food was good- I had the baked eggs and my friend had the benedict with the pesto hollandaise. We also shared the nutella french toast, which had to be taken to go since we definitely over ordered.The really disappointing part was how long it took for our food to come. Not just food, but cappuccinos!! It must have taken at least 30 minutes for two CAPPUCCINOS. (meaning it took almost an hour for food) We kindly told the bartender that we were still waiting and ...""I know. It's coming"". Ten minutes later they arrive. The restaurant was mildly busy, but coffee shouldn't take that long. And if it's that busy or you're short staffed, just check in with your customers! We can be understanding. And we were the only ones sitting at the bar at the time!Even though we enjoyed the food (though not sure if it was because we were starving when we got it), we were pretty annoyed that it took that long with no apologies or check ins. Probably will not be coming back."," The food was good- I had the baked eggs and my friend had the benedict with the pesto hollandaise.

"A very welcoming restaurant with beautiful outdoor seating. Have passed this literally every week when we go grocery shopping and when today the question of brunch came up, we decided to give this place a try. It has spacious seating both indoor and outdoor. The staff was excellent and catered to our requests quite gracefully. We ordered goat cheese omlette and chicken sandwich (our waiter was kind enough to accept my request to substitute grilled chicken for fried cutlet). We had to wait for over 30 minutes, which was okay because I really like to relax during brunch rather than shoving everything down quickly.The food arrived very cold, which kinda ruined every good things I just listed above. Also the pesto or the tomato in my sandwich was very rotten that I choked after eating that. Besides the rotten part, the cutlet was good (I feel weird saying this btw).Don't think I will be returning here."," A very welcoming restaurant with beautiful outdoor seating The staff was excellent and catered to our requests quite gracefully.

"Very disappointing. **EVERYONE, MAKE SURE TO CHECK IF THE BILL MATCHES THE PRICES LISTED ON THE MENU** I've attached a picture of our bill and the menu because I did not believe this situation.When we got the bill, we realized that our server charged us 2 dollars extra on all 3 dishes that we ordered. We brought this up to the server and asked to see the menu again (this was when I took the picture below to show comparison for fellow yelpers). Our server then tells us that she heard that there were some price changes ""last week"" but was not sure and that she had to speak to someone regarding this. Then some guy comes out and talks to our server right behind us talking very loud and clear about this situation as if they wanted us to listen and says, ""Someone must have brought up our old menus from storage. But you can take out the 6 dollars from their bill.""Just out of curiosity, I just went on their website to check if there had been any price changes to the weekday brunch menu since the menus they gave us were ""old menus from storage"" but seems like they haven't updated their ""old menus"" online either. Just sounds like a bunch of bs to me. As for food, we ordered the CALIFORNIA BENEDICT, SCAMPI & GRITS and ITALIAN FRIED CHICKEN & BUTTERMILK WAFFLE with a side of HOME FRIES and APPLEWOOD SMOKED BACON. The food was decent, nothing spectacular. Portions were pretty big, we all had some leftovers. I liked the decor and ambience of this place, cute spot.

"Occasion: Sunday brunch with a friendFood:Italian Fried Chicken with Waffle ($18)CappuccinoThe fried chicken was cooked very well - retaining the right balance of moist and crunchiness. And it was huge! Together with the butter and syrup glazed waffle, it was a fulfilling and delicious combo! Also a honorary mention: the Cappuccino was surprisingly good - aromatic, strong, and smooth with the perfect amount of foam.I took one star off because the toilet was kinda a mess.

"Good food at reasonable prices in a beautiful restaurant with friends ? What's not to like ? Came here on my short vacation for a little breakfast and I was not disappointed. The service was good and the food was also very good. It's a very relaxing place with these gorgeous windows that made me wish my husband would have been there with me. Anyone that knows me knows well that I love small local spots. They need a bigger menu but it was good food at a fair price. If I'm ever in that neighborhood again I'll go back and try something more adventurous.

"Had a lovely brunch here with friends. Came on a Saturday around 11:30. We were seated immediately.  The service was very attentive, and the food was great. The menu has interesting and inventive brunch options. We were all satisfied with the taste and portion size of our dishes. I had the Nutella filled Texas toast. It was a delicious dish-- the toast was not too doughy, nor too sweet. Well balanced and tasty.The restaurant has a nice sunny outdoor seating.

"A very cute, hip and spacious location tucked away in a more quiet and peaceful part of Astoria. Locale is fun and a great date night spot! Love the huge glass exterior giving the place a very ""NYC"" type of vibe. The food here is absolutely delicious! Met up with a couple girls here and we tried various items from the menu. We started off with their cheese platter with came with various cheese and bread. If you love cheese then this is a great way to explore your cheese buds. We also had their crostini trio with hummus artichoke, Burrata bruschetta and olive mix. OMG! The Burrata here is to die for! And upon inquiring about it the waitress informed me that it's homemade, which made the experience even more heavenly. Soft, gooey, yummy cheese that you won't be able to get enough of! Then, we shared an entree of the Gnocchi with truffle! Unique and creamy flavor, yet not as heavy as it looked which was great (if you're not a fan of truffles then this is not for you). Our waitress was awesome and service was excellent! They also offer a great brunch menu here which I'm definitely coming back!"," The food here is absolutely delicious!

Came here for a weekend brunch. Cute space with a small surprise birthday party going on in the back section. We sat at the bar because the tables are full. The bartender who served us was welcoming.

"I think it's a good brunch spot here. I went here to try their oyster sandwich and smoke atlantic salmon crostino. I find it to be wonderful experience. I especially love the bread as it gave it a crunch texture from every bite you take. The poach eggs were pretty good and on spot. The place has a nice environment. It's good to take for the weekend brunch. I do have suggestions on improving the taste of the salad and roasted potatoes, which prevents me to give it a full five stars. The salad taste a bit bitter to me, but not sure if it's the salad dressing or not. Also, I feel that the potatoes should be moist yet crisp.

"Came for brunch and was very excited to be coming back here because I remembered the dinners being pretty good. When I saw one of my favorite country staples on the menu, I was overjoyed. However, what I received was quite a sad excuse for biscuits and gravy. My first gripe was the gravy, it was watery and tasted like they simply took a bit of hollandaise sauce and put some pan drippings in it to darken the color. Country gravy is supposed to be thick and milk based, made with chunks of sausage and sausage grease, loaded with pepper and spice. My second issue with the extremely thin buttermilk biscuit it arrived on, i'm going to guess the kitchen forgot the leaving agent because this thing was more like a dense pancake.TLDR Summary; Stick with the italian food and avoid the biscuits and gravy."," Came for brunch and was very excited to be coming back here because I remembered the dinners being pretty good.

The water was great; it was all down here from there. Our waitress was sweet. But the food was not to be desired. We went to a different place for dessert. Just a cool place to get a drink, The water was great; it was all down here from there. Our waitress was sweet.
"I would have given your location 4 stars if the bartender would have not gotten upset over the fact that I pointed out my glass was dirty. I'm sorry but I refuse to drink from a dirty glass. As for the food the chef is a master indeed, the California egg benedict was made to perfection this includes the the home fries.  We also had the eggs benedict over a biscuit with gravy.....which was delicious.  As for the decor it's very hip and calls you in.

"Gastroteca is a great, inexpensive brunch spot in Astoria. I got the fried eggplant and burrata sandwich which was incredible, and a glass of mango juice. This place is extremely affordable- my sandwich was only about $12 and came with a salad or fries. I would recommend this place if you're in Astoria."," Gastroteca is a great, inexpensive brunch spot in Astoria.

"Where do I start? We dropped by Gastroteca on a Sunday for brunch. It was our first time there and the decor from the outside drew is in although the ratings were not very high.I ordered the Bloody Mary to start and I must say, it had all the works but the taste was uninspiring. In it was cauliflower, celery, pickle and an olive amongst other fashionable ingredients but the flavor of the drink tasted watered down with only a bit of spice to show for it.For food, my girl got the California Benedict. She didn't seem to mind it much but she would later say it was just ok.I ordered the smoked salmon crostino with greens (trying to be healthy). The salmon was fishy and when I took a bite of the salad and I felt some sand but I hoped it was my imagination and finished the first bite. But my second bite made me have to spit the food out. I had to hunt down a server to complain and ask for home fries.Not being satisfied, we got the check only to find out they had charged us for coffee which we did not order. When I pointed this out to a server, he told me he'd get our server to fix it but the check came back with no revisions, forcing me to get up, go to the bar and make it more obvious.My final (and additional) thoughts on this place is that the employees are there more to socialize than to actually work a living. They were all just standing around or running around and not paying much attention. This place is not even worth the Yelp check-in and 10% discount!""Worst experience ever."" - my fiancé when I told her just now that I'm writing this review"," It was our first time there and the decor from the outside drew is in although the ratings were not very high.I ordered the Bloody Mary to start and I must say, it had all the works but the taste was uninspiring.

"Used to be called Locale before a new owner bought the joint. nice scene for a brunch spot. tables are small, venue is a bit cramped, with high ceilings and lots of sunlight. Had the smoked salmon, didn't like it. the eggs benedict was alright. Unfortunate i had hair on my food even though they took it off the bill. Only reason id recommend this place is to have their sugar dusted texas french toast - its a must try!"," nice scene for a brunch spot tables are small, venue is a bit cramped, with high ceilings and lots of sunlight."
Really nice brunch spot. We came here before going to the museum of the moving image. The eggs Benny was really good. My dad ordered the waffle but apparently the waffle machine was broken? So he got the Texas toast instead which was divine., Really nice brunch spot. The eggs Benny was really good.
****check the restaurants website for current menu...menu posted on this page is not current and slightly different Really good Italian food! Had some crostinis to start all were delicious! I think the deal was get 3 for $10 and they cut them in half which was perfect for my boyfriend and i to share. I had the spaghetti in a tomato Sauce with burrata cheese melted on top. SOOO amazing! My boyfriend had the veal which melted in your mouth. He only wished it came with a sauce but he used my extra sauce to dip. Tiramisu was light and fluffy...I usually like more espresso flavor but it was still good. Service was very good.

Great neighborhood spot. I love to sit outside in the warmer weather with a glass of their Super Tuscan and a bowl of Carbonara or Cacio e Pepe. My only complaint is that they can be a bit inconsistent in flavor some days being better than others. Their brunch carbonara topped off with an egg is just what the weekend ordered., Great neighborhood spot My only complaint is that they can be a bit inconsistent in flavor some days being better than others.
"Locale for drinks only. Checked in for 10% off total bill. Merci! Service was helpful when recommending specialty cocktails, however 4 drinks for our table took what felt like an eternity to receive. Womp womp. Ambiance is very cool. I want to live there!

"This is my go-to place since I live quite close. Great pasta, really nice waitstaff (they were very accommodating to my mom, who has a million restrictions and tends to be rude/cranky in restaurants). Only thing I would complain about is the baked eggs terra cotta. Definitely assumed they would be, you know, BAKED. But when I got them, they were completely runny - almost like they'd just cracked them and thrown them in. Granted, this was an order for pick-up, not eat in, so maybe that's the issue. But really? Not baked at all? They're in my oven now for half an hour. Truly annoying. So, GT, please specify if the dish will not actually be cooked. Everything else is great."," This is my go-to place since I live quite close.

"Roomie and I came for Sunday brunch around 12:30-1pm. We were both starving and looking forward to relaxing and enjoying our meal. We both ordered egg dishes, the California Benedict and the spinach and goat cheese omelet. I was satisfied with my omelet. The portion was filling and the flavors all melded well. My roommate seemed happy with her dish as well however the side of bacon left something else to be imagined. I subtracted a star for service. The waiter appeared to be overwhelmed (yes it was busy) but it also started to stress me out. We also waited a bit to be served.

"Negative brunch experience. Will not be returning. I had made a Opentable rezzie which was accommodated quickly, but after being seated, it took 20 minutes to get menus and water. We waited an hour for our brunch entrees and when I asked the server what was happening, she said that several patrons and 2 large groups had come in at the same time and there was a glitch in the computer system and the kitchen was backed up. She then apologized 3 times but not genuinely. More in the ""whattaya gonna do?"" vibe.To make matters worse, we got the bill and I was expecting some sort of % off for the poor food service. Nope. Full price on everything. No ""I'm sorry dessert"" or ""drinks are on the house"" apology from the manager. Come on, man. It would have been the least you could do for making us wait so long for appetizer-sized brunch plates which ranged in price from $9.50-$15.00 plus beverages.Luckily I used my Yelp promo code to get 10% off the bill. I told several people about my experience immediately after and they had said the owner and management changed and the quality of the food and service had gone down. It definitely shows!The best part - my portobello benedict had undercooked eggs. I mean, the egg white was still albumen clear. I didn't realize until after I had taken a bite and I had to go to Lockwood AND Ravenshead to use the bathroom! Thanks for the stomach ailment!AND P.S., Ravenshead has $15 unlimited brunch, large sized portions, no wait, no attitude and friendly staff.

"We had a lovely experience. Sat at the bar, no hassle, no wait, during brunch time. The outdoor seating was being hogged up, but the place is so airy that it all felt as if we were outside. The decor and ambiance are excellent, and the service at the bar was perfect. The food was good and the drinks were strong.

"Best Italian place in Astoria, hands down. There's no pizza on the menu which is a major plus. Everything I've tried here so far has been amazing. They do weekday brunches which is perfect for someone like me who works over the weekends. My personal favorites are the crispy gnocchi and the spaghetti with blue crab.

"Last night was my second visit to Gastroteca, a restaurant that's rapidly becoming a favorite. Located on a pretty, tree-lined street in Astoria, the cuisine is northern Italian; the ambiance is rustic hip; the service is impeccable, and the food is delectable and creative. The space is spacious with high brick walls, two levels, outdoor seating, a comfortable bar, and subtitled movies playing. On our first visit the young co-owner, who couldn't have more hospitable and welcoming, greeted us. The second time, Greg, the comely manager, was our host. He was suave, charming, and attentive. Our favorite waiter is Robert, an encyclopedia of information about food and the world. The food itself is fabulous. For appetizers, try the crostini with a selection of exotic toppings like ricotta, hazelnut, truffle honey or fig jam, ricotta, prosciutto. The burrata with lightly pickled spring vegetables, charred shallots, and agrodolce was the freshest I've had outside Italy. If they have them, don't miss the arancini with mozzarella and prosciutto. There's a good selection of primi piatti and secondi. One night I had risotto with sweet sausage, kale, fragioli and a fried egg. My companions had tagliata and bronzino. Last night it was cavatelli with lamb sausage and mint pesto. My companion had salads and veal meatballs. We shared a chocolate pots de crème for dessert and wished we had ordered two. The wine list is not extensive, but comprehensive and is well priced, as is the food.Astoria is an easy trip from Manhattan, so don't be daunted. It's worth getting on a subway or going over the bridge."," Last night was my second visit to Gastroteca, a restaurant that's rapidly becoming a favorite.

"Came here because we wanted to stay close locally and the place looked quaint and cute from the outside.  Big mistake.Sure, the place is gorgeous.  Outside seating with huge spacious tables and couches inside.  Classy urban decor akin to a West Elm/Pottery Barn hybrid.  The good news stops there.We had literally three different servers who were all over the place.  The first one sat us down, brought us our waters, and then disappeared.  The second one comes to take our orders, doesn't even bother to explain the specials or dessert of the day, and then saunters off to a big family who was celebrating a birthday and sticks to them for the rest of the night, completely ignoring us (can you make it any more obvious you were hustling for the tip?) while explaining to them in great detail what the specials were.  The third one stayed with us throughout the meal until the bill came.  The nightmare began with the food.  We ordered calamari to start which was good (can you really go wrong with that?), and then the house pastas which take about 20 min to prepare because they're made fresh.  They ran out of linguine, so they substituted with tagliatelle.  Portions were so small, I thought they were appetizers at first.  I was finished within a few forkfuls.  All that hype and commotion for $17?  It wasn't even that good.  I could've made a better version of my rigatoni.We wanted creme brulee, and then we're told they're out of tiramisu, creme brulee, and some other thing.  So we order the bread pudding instead.  Sugar overload.  I'm still regretting it.Overpriced mediocre food with spotty service along with multiple unavailable items on the menu?  Nah."," Big mistake.Sure, the place is gorgeous.

"So happy to have found this place in Astoria! It's small with both a dining area and a ""lounge"" area, which is where we sat. We LOVED the 50s-70s music playing and the hangman game going on at the bar.The menu is mostly Italian with a modern twist. We started with 3 crostinos to share- ricotta and honey, burrata, and truffle asparagus w/ runny egg. So hard to choose which was the best, but I'd say my favorite was the last- can't resist a runny yolk!. We then went with the lamb meatballs which were EXCELLENT, and the green lasagna- so filling! Couldn't pass up the almond brownie with marshmallow and gelato! Cocktails were also great- I had the vanilla voltaire and the cinema paradiso with dessert. Both vodka-based and both amazing. The bartender told us that he came up with them himself, so we were definitely impressed!

"What a surprise! We are a family of four and each one of us loved our dish. The atmosphere was casual with large industrial windows allowed natural light into the restaurant.

"Locale is a very cute and hippy location in Astoria. Away from the main street region with a little bit of peace. However, during a hot day, they only have fans on which was very hot and humid inside the restaurant. Not to mention one of the fan was kind of broken. We had eight people in total for brunch. The location doesn't offer unlimited drinks and each of the mimosa costs about 7 each. I did like the flavor of the mango and passion mimosa's. However, it did take 20 minutes for those drinks to come.After ordering food, it took another 40 minutes for food to come, even though the place wasn't packed. The cobb salad I got was ok, nothing special about it. However, the lamb special was pretty good. If they can shorter the wait time and add brunch special to the drinks, i would definitely return."," Away from the main street region with a little bit of peace However, during a hot day, they only have fans on which was very hot and humid inside the restaurant.

"A three.four brunch spot. It's a super solid brunch spot but just a few more things and it could have been a four star or higher restaurant/brunch spot.But first off, props to the bartender who was also our server. We were seated at the bar during a busy Sunday (although coincidentally a few minutes later a few seats opened up) and our bartender was not only able to keep up with her busy position but was also able to take our order, have the food come out quickly, and was checking in on us and refilling our water or soda without even asking. Fantastic service from her.Now what may have stopped the review from being a full on four star review was that although the food was satisfying and tasted just great it didn't really stand out too much. It wasn't underwhelming but it just didn't really blow our minds. I had the Ham, swiss, and mushroom omelet with home fries. Now although it tasted just fine, there really wasn't much flavor of cheese, nor was there much ham in the omelet at all. I did find a few mushrooms. And in addition it didn't seem a little ""liquidy?"" The toast it came with did taste good and the extra order of the side of American bacon I ordered tasted amazing. It was nice and crispy. My girlfriend ordered the California Benedict (which comes with avocado and roasted tomato) and that was pretty good. She had ordered a side of sausage which...was more like a beef patty and didn't have much flavor to it.The home fries were home fries.Overall it was a good experience and I'd be willing to come back here to try other things on the menu.

Please.  Side note, only one of those five open tables came. We could have sat there.  My recommendation is skip their brunch... but their dinner is still worthwhile.  The end.  Forgot to mention the servers, the ones who actually bring and take plates... were very sweet and kind.  Maybe I'm old fashioned but I think old school places work better where one person takes order and brings food.  It incentivizes good service."," But were told by a condescending hostess that they were all reserved We were lookin around as to where we could hang out jackets.

"Absolutely terrible service. Don't bother making a reservation, it clearly does not matter. After waiting 40 minutes at the bar we still had not been seated. The restaurant clearly does not care about providing good customer service. After sitting down, the service still sucked. Horrible, horrible experience with extremely mediocre food. Overpriced garbage."," Absolutely terrible service. Horrible, horrible experience with extremely mediocre food."
"Went back today - the last review was from when it was Locale. Anyway, much better meal this time (the shrimp/sausage/polenta dish is amazing) and delicious spicy drink, Freddy Krueger, which is a jalapeño Bloody Mary. The service was fine but slow when getting check, but overall a good experience. Love the many windows and the brightness inside.", Love the many windows and the brightness inside
Brunch at 4Had the poached eggs. Expertly crafted soft biscuits not doughy with a hard poached egg (not runny) and topped with a light gravy. Perfect for a light but filling breakfast.Service here is a notch above the rest. Beyond the refills of drinks comes salesmanship and concern for the pleasure of the customer. Try the freddy krueger. Its a bloody mary wi spicy vodka! They do get friendly wi the toppings.

"Great for dinner and for brunch but holy overpriced hell, a tad on the high side :/The decor is splendid, French windows, letting perfect light in during the day and shining perfect candle light out at night, very romantic, European vibe to it. Tasty Crostinis, fave was fig and goat cheese. They make their pasta in house, we had the Tagliatelle with truffle oil and veggies, definitely tasty but DRY, too dry for any pasta dish, especially one that's a small size and costs almost $20. The wine selection is nice, plenty of dishes to choose from on the menu, lovely place overall. GREAT for a date in my opinion, maybe just not a first date, you may creep him/her with the ""romantic-ness"" of this place."," The wine selection is nice, plenty of dishes to choose from on the menu, lovely place overall.

"Food, staff, service, drinks, ambience, prices all on point. Very decent happy hour ($3 Stella/Amstel light, $4 founder IPA, $5 wine). We had two salads and loved them both.pasta was great as well.

"2.5 stars. Good ambience. Slow service. Have three different types of eggs benedict on the menu, but my poached egg was extremely overcooked (hard yolk) which kills eggs benedict in my opinion.  The baked eggs was flavorful and filling. Ok food, nothing special.", The baked eggs was flavorful and filling.
"The best brunch place in Astoria. We had vegetable terra cotta, gnocchi, and California  Benedict, and they were all fantastic. Our waiter the last time was a bit snobbish, acting like he had other, more important things to do and we were interrupting him, but other than that great spot in Astoria", The best brunch place in Astoria
"I have gone here a few times and always have had a good meal.  I enjoy the fried eggs with cheddar polenta and keep having the same dish when I go, but others have had the California Benedict and various omelets and have enjoyed those. Lots of interesting drink choices as well. Service is friendly and attentive. I like eating outside here in the summer", Lots of interesting drink choices as well enjoy
"Went here for Fathers Day. Great medium sized restaurant thats away from the main hustle bustle of Broadway. The crostinis are delicious and each one is easily shareable by two people so you can sample and discover your favorites.The mussles here in the garlic sauce were perfect. Probably better than some seafood restaurants and french places ive gone to.Vanilla voltaire is a fantastic drink if you're looking for some cocktails.The steak was declious. A little bit overcooked but im not too fussy so I didn't bother to send it back or anything. I ordered a medium and it came out closer to well done.Wait staff is very attentive and smiles al around and it shows they like where they work, which is great to see compared to other restaurants in are where they look like theyre counting down the minutes to go home.The decor of the place is what I'd call vintage 2.0 where early 1900s meets modern conveniences throughout such as built in speakers for music and tvs around. The music is catchy too that they play but it be even more awesome if they played some old school vinyl records or hits to match the decor, maybe not every night but it be a welcome change up from hearing the music you usually hear on the radio....actually a good balance would be finding bands like Scott Bradlee and Post Modern Jukebox who takes pop hits and transforms them to motown verisons etc...playing their music from time to time would really add to the unique atmosphere provided by the space and help separate it further from the generic ultra modern spots in Astoria.Definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner for a date, family outing and groups of friends. Id say make a reservation through opentable though as the place did fill up."," The crostinis are delicious and each one is easily shareable by two people so you can sample and discover your favorites.The mussles here in the garlic sauce were perfect.

"Great choice for cold weather.Great design by the folks at Locale for incorporating an additional pathway onto the front door that prevented the cold draft from creeping into the restaurant every time someone opens the door. (I guess the owners look at Yelp responses seriously and took the previous feedback into consideration.)The restaurant decor was FANtastic and had an eerie comfort to it. My girlfriend and I were lucky and got seated on top of the podium in the corner. The seats were very comfortable, which made the hike through the storm worth it. She got the Sugar Dusted Texas Toast stuffed with Nutella...and DAM that's some good sweets. Crunchy soft and warm french toast slightly breaded with cornflakes (is that what it was?) And than stuffed generously with Nutella with a side of syrup. ...OYEah.I got the portobello bendict with wilted spinach and truffle oil...Not a typical dish I would order since there's no meat in it, but it did the job. The mushroom appeared to be infused with balsamic vinegar which gave it a nice tangy kick. Hollandaise sauce and egg was perfecto, nice proportion and consistency with the overall size of meal. The truffle oil just brought everything together, happily together..than again when does it not? Had homefries on the side but didn't care much for it. So the meals were perfect but drinks..not so much. I believe it was slightly over priced. The ""freddy krueger"" which was just a spicier version of the bloody mary .. $9, seriously?  That's the same price as the first dish we got. Maybe if it was $6 or $7, i wouldve gotten another 1-2 refills. After we finished our drinks, the waitress came around and asked if we wanted another round with a smirk on her face. She probably knew we were going to say 'no' but still asked...wonder why she had the smirk?? Wait, but ask us how our food was? Guess she nor anyone else there cared much for that.Overall, our two dishes were great and where we got seated was nice including the overall decor of the restaurant. Minor details need work on but I would not mind coming back..."," Great choice for cold weather.Great design by the folks at Locale for incorporating an additional pathway onto the front door that prevented the cold draft from creeping into the restaurant every time someone opens the door. )The restaurant decor was FANtastic and had an eerie comfort to it.

"Perhaps, I was reconnecting with a homegirl over wine, talkin' about love, spirituality and the calm after the storm. And this joint made it feel zen. Sweet waitress, fast ass service, lightning bolt bartender....and it was chill and quiet (despite being busy) and lovely.Skatefish appetizer with avocado puree was delish, slightly battered and fried. It was a specialSwordish with purpleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee potatoes and crispy onion strings. Being a kid at heart and a chip lover, I think I decided to get this cuz of the onion strings. Kinda like a salt filling magnet, you know. Nonetheless, the fish was cooked perfectly. Silky and gulpy. don't listen to them wine buffs about white with fish. Malbec and fish is also just as marvelous. MmmHomegirl got duck breast. At the first bite, it unraveled me in regards to other finer establishments like Jean Georges which served an almond crusted duck breast and automatically, folks gon be like ""oooooooooooo danggg"" but it was so confusing in the mouth--too craycray of a fushion for me. Sorry Jean.  An entree like the duck breast. tasted simpler here at Locale and juicier. sometimes you just like shiz as simple as possible. dug this place a lot."," And this joint made it feel zen Sweet waitress, fast ass service, lightning bolt bartender....and it was chill and quiet (despite being busy) and lovely.Skatefish appetizer with avocado puree was delish, slightly battered and fried.

Fantastic spot. Servers are on the ball and attentive. Food is DIVINE. Atmosphere is perfect. Great bar. The service is top notch., The service is top notch.
"The former Local still offers up the same American/Italian fare under a completely different name. Gastroteca- as explained by our exemplary waitstaff, is a portmanteau of gastropub and the Italian enoteca, which they is present in their menu, with a melding of Italian and American dishes.It's super cozy, yet out of the way- the bustle of 30th ave is far away, so this stands out as a gem on 36th (although nearby is Mar's and Snowdownia), but still a spot that should be visited. The brunch Bloody Mary comes with a side of salad- carrots in a Bloody Mary are a surprise- because when I'm finished with the olive, the pickle, the cucumber, the carrot has soaked up a delivers the rest of the booze with a crunch. Good stuff.Crispy Gnocchi w/ pistachio, spinach, basil pesto, ricotta salate- perfect. The gnocchi has a slight crunch to it, which for most of the doughy Gnocchi I've had is welcome relief. Very light and very unassuming, as when I was feeling stuffed after four bites. It's definitely for the hearty eater.If visiting the area for brunch, put this on your list. If you live in the area, put this on your list. If you are from out of town, ask your friends/family that live in the area to take you here."," The former Local still offers up the same American/Italian fare under a completely different name.

The place is nice mellow environment limited menu. NOTE don't order the chicken club sounds good but it's not happening very dull and tasteless.

"Perfect brunch spot for delicious cocktails and somewhat new take on brunch inspired dishes.  For example, I ordered the California Benedict, which is eggs Benedict minus the Canadian ham but with avocado.  It was a delicious combination I would definitely order it again. My friend ordered the smoked salmon omelette that came with hashbrowns and she loved it. My other friends ordered the regular omelette and loved that as well. The cocktails were delicious they had mango, passion and regular mimosas, mojitos, bloody marys and my personal fave, the ""Freddy Krueger"" which was a very special bloody Mary with a peppered rim, and goat cheese stuffed olive and of couse, the celery stick!!!  YummyThe atmosphere is nice and cozy, feels like you are in someone's living room.  High ceilings, curtains, beautiful wallpaper and lots if windows."," Perfect brunch spot for delicious cocktails and somewhat new take on brunch inspired dishes.

"Really, really enjoyed this place for brunch. I rarely venture into Queens but will be doing so more because of my experience at Gastroteca! I absolutely loved the modern, open space inside. It was simultaneously country/rustic but had that trendy white brick walls and bright red wood for all the tables. We had made a reservation for 12p on a Saturday and it wasn't too packed, but by 1-1:30 it became much more crowded. (0.5 point knocked off for the smell of smoke on our waiter from his seemingly recent smoke break)I got one of their eggs benedict specials with roasted potatoes and bacon the side. All very fresh and well-prepared. I also love how it the restaurant seemed to be a bit off the beaten path. 34th Ave seemed to be quieter, which is always a nice thing in this city.Definitely going to come back!", I rarely venture into Queens but will be doing so more because of my experience at Gastroteca!

"I'm a local at Locale (teehee). Its my go-to neighborhood restaurant for that special occasion, girl's night out, or morning after brunch. I take my mom here. It my friend's default first date location. All with good reason!Locale has consistently great food that won't make your wallet cry in the morning. Its comparable to a lot of really good meals you'll have in Manhattan with a shave off the price, less competition for a table, and much less pretentiousness. The brunch is good (eggs benedict is superb) and the waffles too. I typically order off the specials off the menu when it comes to dinner, which is like getting a great surprise every time I eat here. The first time it was a rack of lamb. The second time it was the seafood linguine. Tonight it was a whole grilled branzino and duck with parsnips. Deeeelish! Chocolate souffle is the go to dessert pretty much every time. The ambiance is chill and cozy. The waitstaff is excellent. And I am always thrilled with the food.

"This place is great for a low-key brunch or a big pow-wow. I had the pleasure of dining at Locale with a group of 11 on a Saturday afternoon and the food, drinks, service and decor were all top-notch. When making the reservations, I had to call twice to make an update to the time & headcount and the staff was super accommodating, which was well appreciated & constitutes a note-worthy mention. The dining area was spacious and both inviting and comfortable with ample outdoor seating, for those that wish to dine al-fresco! We ordered a number of different dishes including the smoked salmon crostini, steak & eggs, and nutella french toast to name a few. The smoked salmon was fresh and complemented nicely with the aioli spread served with a fried egg on top and the nutella french toast was a star of its own, as it was devoured quickly among the group. The french toast was perfectly crispy while the nutella melts in your mouth. We all had a great time and were happily satisfied with our meals.  I couldn't have imagined any other way to spend a Saturday brunch with friends!

"Stellar meal. Went after seeing pictures on Instagram week after week, finally got off our butts and went for dinner. For cocktails I had the tully, which was Hendricks gin, grapefruit, cilantro, and bitters. My girlfriend had the honey comb which was bourbon (I think?) chamomile tea, lemon and sugar, served hot. Perfect since it was such a rainy night!Started with three Crostinos: bacon and black pepper aioli, burrata with white bean hummus and tomato sauce, and a special one with roasted garlic purée, basil, and (I forget which) cheese. All fabulous.I had rigatoni bolognese. The sauce was perfectly seasoned and the texture of the fresh made pasta was so great, perfectly al dente. My girlfriend had the crispy pesto gnocchi. We loved it because we had never had anything like it. Seriously, crispy gnocchi? How do you do thatFor dessert we shared the coconut panna cotta with coconut sorbet and guava soup, and the dark chocolate cake with burnt orange ice cream. I honestly loved everything, and have no complaints other than that I completely forgot to use my 10% off yelp coupon, but that's my own fault! Seriously.

"The food is small portioned but great and our server was doing anything he could to accommodate us, but what I am assuming is the management is lacking majorly here. We came one Friday or Saturday night, made a reservation through open table. checked in and waited at our table for the other members of our group. Unbeknownst to me, one of the other members of our party ended up needing to bring her daughter. They did have a high chair...but absolutely no food to accommodate children. We asked if French fries were possible or a spaghetti with marinara? No and no ""No French fries on Fridays""  I could tell in the servers face hat he was embarrassed and said I'll see what I can do, he spoke to the manager and came back with a disappointed face. So the evening goes on and we had our entrees and everything was delicious. I rarely ever finish my entire plate of food...so that means it was great but honestly very small portions  for the price. The thing that threw my entire evening off was them proceeding to close up the restaurant at 11pm. On a weekend. A member of our group wanted to treat the table so had gotten up to do so without anyone knowing. The waiter came back and handed the already processed card receipt over and informed us that our friend (who had stepped outside to smoke) had paid. I asked the waiter if I could have another glass of wine and I would pay cash on a separate check. The waiter walked over to that manager one more time, and came back with a disappointed face one more time. He said I'm sorry we can't. I was in shock after just spending close to $200 on a mediocre meal for four that I wasn't allowed one more glass of wine. What restaurant closes this early in Astoria on a weekend? The food was good, and I have always wanted to try brunch here but maybe when management takes a course in accommodating guests, I'll think about it."," The food is small portioned but great and our server was doing anything he could to accommodate us, but what I am assuming is the management is lacking majorly here. checked in and waited at our table for the other members of our group We asked if French fries were possible or a spaghetti with marinara?

"Locale is located in a quiet part of Astoria (well, a block away from bustling Broadway). Since it is a small space, the tables are kind of close together and it gets loud so do not expect to have quiet conversations. Our server was friendly and attentive. Our coffee mugs never got past the half empty point as servers kept coming around with refills.I really enjoyed all aspects of my meal. Their Portabello Benedict and Nutella Stuffed French Toast were to die for. The home fries were well seasoned and delicious. What is that amazing slightly crisp/buttery topping they put on top of the French Toast? I am guessing it was crack since I cannot wait to come back!"," enjoy Since it is a small space, the tables are kind of close together and it gets loud so do not expect to have quiet conversations.

We went here for brunch for the first time today and it was a great experience. I got eggs benedict and my girlfriend got the spinach and goat cheese omelette.

We'll definitely be back!, The food was good but even better than the food was the service! We'll definitely be back!
"I drove by this place a few times and was mesmerized by the damask wallpaper, and I knew that I had to try this place.  After coming here for a brunch though, I have to say the physical space and decor were the best thing about it.One of the most attractive things about this place is the ambiance.  The restaurant itself is on a corner and has nearly two full walls of windows.  The back corner is on a bit of a platform, which makes for an interesting view if you're seated there.  Also, in the summer, they have a fair amount of outdoor seating on a not-too-busy street.  As I said, I went here for brunch, so I can only really speak about my experience of their brunch menu.  I had the California Benedict, which was a standard eggs benedict with avocado.  My friend ordered a spinach and goat cheese omelet.  Both dishes were good, but there wasn't anything special about it.  The eggs were cooked as we expected, but there wasn't much flavor.  The sides were also standard--nothing too exciting.This place is a fine place for standard brunch, but I don't know that I would return her for anything specific.  The area has so many other restaurants that I'd rather try what others have to offer before coming here again."," After coming here for a brunch though, I have to say the physical space and decor were the best thing about it.One of the most attractive things about this place is the ambiance.

"A good menu that's not too big--hooray for some focus.  The desserts are delicious too (the boyfriend prefers the chocolate cake while I'm partial to the brownie).  Nice big windows and opportunities to sit outside in the good weather.  As I was trying to pick between orange juice and tea, the cheery waitress suggested an orange-flavored tea.  A great beverage solution, and grateful she didn't push the up-sell.  Going here for brunch is much more pleasant than trying to do the same in Manhattan."," The desserts are delicious too (the boyfriend prefers the chocolate cake while I'm partial to the brownie).

"Came here for brunch. Overall, I thought the service and ambiance were nice. The portobella benedict was good, though I would have like more portabella on my benedict, and more home fries on the side (definitely stingy there). I like the diversity of the menu, which includes brunch staples as well as more unique additions. For a nice Astoria brunch, the prices are average and the food is good. It's not crowded either, so if you live in the 'hood it might do you well to come here instead of heading into the city for your benedict. Also, they take reservations for brunch, while some of my favorite Manhattan brunch haunts do not."," Came here for brunch Overall, I thought the service and ambiance were nice.

"The California Benedict is a joke -- ""avocado"" promised on the menu is a couple dollops of guacamole and you could hardly make out the roasted tomato at all under the poached egg. And while the service started strong, it quickly reverted to Locale's old reliable ineptitude (I was hoping that would not be inherited in the turnover) as I was left without a beverage throughout the majority of my entree (promised hot water for tea never came and my empty water glass never filled.)"," The California Benedict is a joke -- ""avocado"" promised on the menu is a couple dollops of guacamole and you could hardly make out the roasted tomato at all under the poached egg.

"I really want to like Locale more... I like the corner of Astoria it's in. I like the decor. I like their ultra friendly and professional wait staff. But even after coming here every so often for dinner, I was never fully sold on it. The #1 thing that warrants my 3 star rating is the food. Don't get me wrong - it's good. I'd say ever so slightly above average actually. But in the 2 years or so I come here, the menu has never changed and even the 'specials' always seem to be the same. You know how you might have a restaurant, cafe, etc. with a signature dish? A dish that really makes you say ""oh man, I just got a hankering for the ABC dish at XYZ establishment?"". Locale doesn't have that. The menu is pretty lackluster; you're standards like veal scallopine, seared salmon, a few pasta dishes, etc. Hey, this might be exotic dining for some, but for me, it's a big yawn. Plus, the last drink my girlfriend has there, a mojito, tasted like someone dropped a shot of dish washing soap in it...Unless someone is treating me here, don't know if I'll actively try to come back any time soon."," I'd say ever so slightly above average actually.

"Solid brunch spot in Astoria on a quiet street. Easily accessible via NQ trains, lots of street parking nearby. Staff is attentive but the kitchen is slooooow.Every item on the menu was ordered - nobody complained, but there wasn't a wave of silence when the food came either. The bloody mary was on par with my expectations (had to ask for tobasco)."," Solid brunch spot in Astoria on a quiet street Staff is attentive but the kitchen is slooooow.Every item on the menu was ordered - nobody complained, but there wasn't a wave of silence when the food came either."
"I used to really love this place. The food has changed and not for the better. My roommate used to come all of the time and has stopped. I decided to give it another go since it is so cute and so close. Service was.. Ok. Everyone was very nice. But it took forever for anyone to come around to clear plates, refill water, take orders and pick up the bill. The starters were not good. The sprout salad wasn't good either. I hardly touched it. Several different people waited on me so that was confusing and I felt lost in the shuffle. I was going to stay for dessert but it took so long for anyone to come back I decided to just get the bill.

"A brunch spot for old friends catching up last minute, we went without reservations but were seated immediately at the bar. The bartender and staff addressed us patiently as we changed our minds a dozen times before finally deciding - hey, we can order it all instead of trying to decide what dish to eat!And so we started off with Bloody Mary-s, and for me, a mango Mojito. Poached eggs with biscuits and gravy, and the Begian waffles for me off the menu. Wow. Totally worth feeling like a fatass. Paired with apple smoked bacon to boot. As for everything else, after my meal I couldn't fit to taste, but the plates were eaten clean and by the look of the satisfied smiles all around, this place is a solid 5 I'd say. Definitely give it a go.10% off bill if you check in, which I forgot to do because I was too busy figuring out what to eat. Boo. Well worth the total bill nonetheless!"," A brunch spot for old friends catching up last minute, we went without reservations but were seated immediately at the bar.

The ambiance in this restaurant was very cute and the wait staff was excellent. I would have to give it lower reviews because the chicken club sandwich I ordered was not good at all. the bread was dry and burned and it was sliced chicken like in deli ham. Not what I anticipated. My sister ordered the waffles which were tasty and looked way better than my chicken club. I need to go back and try another meal before I can give it a better review., The ambiance in this restaurant was very cute and the wait staff was excellent.

"Went here last Sunday with two friends because we were able to make a reservation and I know how crazy brunch can get in Astoria.  The best way to describe Locale is meh.  Two of us got the Chicken Club Sandwich which comes with prosciutto, avocado and garlic aioli.  Those are three of my favorite things so I figured the sandwich had to be great.  Unfortunately, the sandwich was just boring.  I should bring up that even though no cheese is listed on the menu, there was cheese melted onto every slice of bread.  I can't eat dairy, so that was an immediate issue for me.  The waitress was more than kind and brought back a cheese-less sandwich very quickly.  I thought maybe the lack of cheese was why my sandwich was so bland, but my friend who ate the sandwich with cheese also found the meal tasteless.  The aioli was really just mayo, the avocado was under ripe and even the prosciutto didn't taste like much.The atmosphere and service are pretty great, though those are really the only high points of my experience at Locale."," I should bring up that even though no cheese is listed on the menu, there was cheese melted onto every slice of bread.

"We were party of 14 and came here for brunch to celebrate my baby shower. When we arrived to the restaurant we were immediately welcomed by the staff and got escorted to our table that was nicely set up at the balcony area. Ambience is very nice at this place. I believe that whenever you celebrate any event it is never great unless you recieve a great service. Our server Allyson was the BEST, absolute sweetheart! Very knowledgeable about the menu, extremely professional, courteous, attentive and provides A+ quality service. She was always around asking if we were fine or needed anything. Our drinks were refilled on time, and they were absolutely delicious. Their Bloody Mary's and Passion mimosas are a must have. It didn't take long food to arrive and everybody were happy with their meal. I ordered steak and eggs, it was really good, right temperature. The only thing, I wish steak could have a little more char grill taste to it. At the end of our meal they brought our cake with candles and flaming torch on it along with warming congratulations.  It was awesome. Overall our experience at Gastroteca was great and I will definitely come back."," Ambience is very nice at this place.

"We went here for brunch today. We are big brunch fans and like to try new places when we can-this place has taken our #1 spot on brunch rankings. I had the Nutella stuffed French toast-it was scrumptious. My friend had the eggs Benedict, which he reviewed as very delicious also.  I also had the Freddy Kreuger-a Bloody Mary with jalapeño infused vodka-which was amazing. The jalapeño vodka gave the Bloody Mary a spicy flavor that made all the difference. I was surprised that the crowd was quite thin on a Saturday at 1130 am-but that just means more brunch for me!

"Let me start off by saying I don't think this place deserves less than a 4 star. That said, this place is a little underwhelming with the food. The menu is brilliant, but when the food comes out, it's just ok. I got the poached eggs with biscuits and gravy and I honestly thought I'd get a side of b&g, but it was just a small portion of 2 biscuit halves with eggs on it and a spoonful of gravy on each. My his mad got an omelette and potatoes and said the potatoes tasted like they had been frozen. However, the food IS tasty, the service is very friendly, the place is clean, and the ambiance is great. The prices are good and you get enough food. It's probably a place better suited for couples and friends, although you could bring well behaved kids here. The seating is very close together and open. I will say that it was a special occasion, my birthday, and I don't feel like they made any kind of big deal about that (like Martha's Bakery on Ditmars did ) I thought hey, maybe a free OJ on the house or something. I've had a nice experience coming here each time with my husband, though, and we'll definitely be back. It's a solid choice for brunch or any other meal or drinks."," Let me start off by saying I don't think this place deserves less than a 4 star.

"I really wanted to like this place but somethings disappointed me a bit.

"We went here for date night on a whim of trying anew place and headed to a movie after. The food was awesome, not a heavy plated Italian place.

"Normally I don't write reviews on Yelp but this place is so great I had to! A few months ago I moved to Astoria and my girlfriend and I came for a drink because it looked really cute and intimate. Not only was the wine great (and at 5 dollars a glass for happy hour very affordable) but their homemade pastas were out of this world. I got the spaghetti stracchino and she got the pappardelle verde (white bolognese sauce), which was a special at the time but it was so popular the restaurant put it on their new fall menu. We've been coming back regularly ever since, and have to say the staff is incredibly warm, friendly, and accommodating. We look forward to coming here all the time and are very excited to try more new dishes on their fall menu!  I highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Astoria--although we try new places from time to time we always say Gastroteca is better and that we wish we had gone there instead."," Normally I don't write reviews on Yelp but this place is so great I had to!

"I want to like this place SO BAD.  This is my third time there.Reasons to disregard my review:1) It was brunch at noon on a Sunday, so it was crowded2) There were two large parties of about 8 (with children) there when we arrived3) I was with a group of 64) I am generally a cranky personBut here's my experience.The good:-The ambiance is great.  Great size, great light, corner restaurant, option for a more secluded area with couches.  - The server was very nice- Decent coffeeThe not-so-good:The food was terrible.  It took 35 minutes (forgiven, you were busy and had two huge parties ahead of us), and when it arrived, 2 of our entrees were cold.  My guy friends ordered the recommended breakfast burrito - said it was mostly cheese and rice.  My waffles were gross AND THEY USED FAKE SYRUP.  We asked for real syrup but were told ""I'm not sure, sometimes we have it but sometimes we don't.""  You're called Locale!!! I guess shame on me for believing the name..?The manager (owner?) came by and asked how everything was so I told him the truth.  He was apologetic, and offered to comp one of the meals.  But he didn't -- gave us free mimosas instead (I was sick so alcohol wasn't appealing).  If you take 35 minutes to bring food and it's cold, you should comp it.  If you charge that much for waffles and bring fake syrup, at least warn me that I'm about to get something gross.  None of us were drinking alcohol with our meal; a round of drinks didn't really do it this time (though I don't deny it was a nice gesture).  $18 later for a coffee and bad waffles and I am not pleased.  My boyfriend ordered the burger and he liked it though.So I don't know.  I'll probably go back - that's how much I want to like this place.   But I'm prepared to have another lackluster experience and wanted to warn others of the same.  There's enough competition in Astoria that this mediocrity doesn't really need to be accepted."," This is my third time there.Reasons to disregard my review:1) It was brunch at noon on a Sunday, so it was crowded2) There were two large parties of about 8 (with children) there when we arrived3) I was with a group of 64) I am generally a cranky personBut here's my experience.The good:-The ambiance is great. - The server was very nice- Decent coffeeThe not-so-good:The food was terrible.

"Went to Locale on a Tuesday night with a friend. This place was cozy, especially in the back area. The ambiance was also nice, making it a perfect place to bring a date. The food was good; the pork chops with green vegetables I ordered was savory; however, the desserts (mixed berry bread pudding and banana/caramel napolean) were mediocre. Maybe it was me but the desserts could've had more flavor. The cost of food was more than I would have liked to have pay for a meal, but its OK to treat yourself every now and again :) Oh, the staff was very friendly."," Went to Locale on a Tuesday night with a friend This place was cozy, especially in the back area.

"Another gem in Astoria! I came here for brunch with the boyfriend on a snowy day. It was a bit of a troop to get there since its difficult to find parking, but it was worth it.Service: We missed our reservation by 10 minutes, but we got lucky that it was a snowy day and people were too lazy to come out. Thank you lazy people :) We got seated right away and they seated us in a nice and loungy area of the restaurant, so that was a plus! So the waitress put in our orders and the orders came in a timely manner. The only fault was the waitress never came by once to ask if everything was ok, but asked if we wanted another round of drinks after she cleared the table. Too bad because there was a full bar waiting for me if she was nicer to begin with. Food: I love anything with nutella! (Almost) So I ordered the Texas sugar dusted toast with an option of stuffed nutella! Why have just plain toast, when you can have nutella in it. Once I got my order and had my first bite, I was in a sweet place. This is comfort food. One thing happens when I eat something amazing is that I eat slowly wishing that it will never end. My boyfriend ordered the Portobello Benedict infused with truffle oil. Anything truffle is amazing ! It was light but delicious. The eggs and portbello just melted in your mouth as you eat it. The home fries didn't have a nice presentation to his dish and it was a bit stale.The drinks portion: I orderd a mango mimosa and he ordered a freddy kreuger ( spicier version of the bloody mary) Both drinks were good.Ambiance: It is a modern and pretty place with an full bar in front. The decor was nice and cozy. The couches were a bit worn out but seatable. It was romantic and relaxing feel to it. Overall: It was a good brunch place.

"I'm a brunch whore. Seriously I love brunch. However up until yesterday I had always ventured (based on assumption alone) that good worth it brunch could only be found in NYC and maybe Brooklyn. Gastroteca put me in my place. Not only was the ambiance of this place perfect for a Sunday brunch - the food rivaled anything we've had in NYC. For the food itself I want to give Gastroteca four stars. However based on the service we received yesterday I'm less inclined to give my overall experience more than 3 stars. Here's how it went down: the hubby and I made reservations the night before for 1230 on Sunday. We got there on time and found the place was completely empty - not a great sign for a Sunday brunch spot. After a few minutes we learned that they were running behind with opening up due to unforeseen kitchen issues. They did let us know that they'd be ready to go in about 45 minutes and if we wanted to come back we could then. The hubby and I were pretty much starving (blame the pregnancy) so we opted to go elsewhere. Fortunate for Gastroteca we are both spontaneous and ended up running errands, allowing us to go back in time for them to be up and running. We called to make sure they were good to go and let them know we would be on our way. Once we got there we had to wait a few minutes for a table to be cleared but the host seemed gracious enough that we came back after we explained our earlier visit. Once seated we felt a little shafted on service. Our server didn't get our order down until at least 10 minutes and then the wait for the food seemed somewhat endless. Once we had our food we were happy and once we got our coffee (and several refills) we were all smiles. One piece of advice that may have pushed my review to four stars - because it's the little things that go a long way, to make up for the inconvenience of not being ready for us at our reservation time it would have been nice if the restaurant offered us a comp'd appetizer or side or just didn't charge us for the coffee. It's a few bucks, but it's the best way to make sure you send someone out with a positive reason to come back. We will likely be back there for brunch - but we would have raved about how Astoria has more heart when it comes to brunch than NYC had we gotten that extra bit of service!"," We got there on time and found the place was completely empty - not a great sign for a Sunday brunch spot.

"Wow! Talk about luck of the draw on picking a restaurant. Saturday night, the plan was to go for Greek.

So I called to find out what the specials were and sadly sea bass wasn't one of them. I then asked how long the wait was for a table of two and was told 35 to 40 minutes. At this point my mom and I were really hungry (dad had to sit dinner out because of the sausage he had at the San Gerrano Fest!) and we didn't want to wait. I figured I'd scope out Open Tables to see if there were any reservations available. It was 7:50, there was a reservation for 8 pm! I booked it and then we literally booked it to the car! Good thing I live right around the corner. And to top it all off, we got a spot right out front, talk about lucky! We did have to wait for another couple to finish settling up on their bill and then have them clean the table off before we were seated but that only took 20 minutes. I was shocked at how busy this place was because it's somewhat off the beaten path in Astoria away from the main drags of 30th and Broadway. While we waited we looked over the menu trying to make the next big food decision. Everything looked amazing. Prior to even being at the restaurant we had looked at the menu online and decided that we were going to have the Beet and Brie salad along with the Salmon as one entree. My mom picked the salmon but I was still at a crossroad of what to order. When we were finally seated, I asked the waitress a few questions about the menu. They had quite a few pasta dishes on the menu that looked amazing but then there was a polenta dish that also looked great. I had of the vegetarian pastas which one she would recommend, of course it was the one with the white truffle sauce. She said it was really heavy and both my mom and I were looking for something on the healthier side. While I was torn between a pasta dish and the polenta dish, my mom suggested that I asked if they'll do a half order of each. While they weren't able to do a half order of the polenta they were able to with the pasta! Boom, done!! So I ordered the Locales Faggotini and the Toasty Polenta. We started with the beet and brie cheese salad. This was roasted beets with warm brie cheese, endive, frisee, toasted almonds, chives and a beet vinaigrette. This salad was delicious! They light fried the cheese and placed a silver dollar size piece on top. The presentation of this was really cool. It looks like they made it a spring form pan with about a 2 to 3 inch layer of beets then the lettuce part on top. You did really need to mix it up in order to get everything dressed nicely in the dressing. It also wasn't over dressed which was nice. Very creative dish that I highly recommend. Then our meals came and for us, we were seated at a two person round table, we really needed a table extension!! The salmon was marinated in a hoisin sauce with fennel, carrots and onion. While this was good, it didn't stand out the way the other two dishes did for my mom and I. The Locale Faggotini: Beggers purse shaped pasta stuffed with gorganzola topped with walnuts in a red beet sauce. I'm so happy we ordered this dish and a half size could truly be a meal within itself. It was important that you had a bite of the pasta with the a walnut because the sharpness of the cheese with the nutty walnut flavor was outstanding. The beet was present but it wasn't a very strong flavor, just enough to give a little bit of sweetness. There was also chopped up beets in the dish and the beet sauce gave the pasta this beautiful pink color. The Toasty Polenta: Polenta topped with Mozzarella, arugula and with a red sauce. This polenta was unlike any polenta I've ever had before. My mom pointed out that all the polenta she has had is always very dense whereas this was really nice and light. We did move the massive piece of mozzarella off to the side while star of the dish was the polenta the sauce is what made the polenta that much better. It was a chunky sauce and you could see the veggies but it had this great kick to it. It wasn't overly spicy but it was just enough heat to add a little bite. I would go back for this dish again and sometime very soon!! Again, I was shocked at how busy it was so it was a little on the noisy side but we were still able to have a conversation at the table. The decor also really caught my eye. It has this rustic yet modern look to it. It's an interesting little space which gives the restaurant a very cozy feel. The service was great and very attentive. Great portions as well not huge but enough to satisfy."," Talk about luck of the draw on picking a restaurant At this point my mom and I were really hungry (dad had to sit dinner out because of the sausage he had at the San Gerrano Fest!)

Incredible food matched by impeccable service. It's the best meal I've had out in a long time!, Incredible food matched by impeccable service.
"Love this place. I come here fairly regularly for brunch because the food is delicious. I highly recommend the benedicts and the texas toast is amazing (it's stuffed with nutella!). It's a little off from central Astoria so it's not usually overcrowded...particularly when the weather is nice since you can sit outside. The wait staff is always friendly and on top of things. Great place for either a casual brunch date or to get your morning started with friends. I've seen everything from families to dates to bridal shower parties here and they all seem to be having a good time. They also play cartoons/television on the wall behind the bar which is an entertaining touch. The one thing I can't vouch for is the drinks/dinner/evening atmosphere because I've never been, but I would certainly be surprised if it was a letdown."," Love this place I come here fairly regularly for brunch because the food is delicious.

"After Saturday night, this is definitely near the top of my list of more upscale places to go for dinner in Astoria. Apparently they do brunch too, but I have not experienced that (yet).FOOD: Our server recommended the Gorgonzola-stuffed pasta dish, and we were not disappointed. Delicious, super filling, and paired with a great (almost magenta colored!) sauce. The braised meatballs appetizer was delish as well, and I'll definitely be back to try their fish and steak entrees. Also? Try the espresso gelato. It is GOOD.WINE: We were allowed to try the Cab Sauv (Snap Dragon) available by the glass, and to be honest, it was quite dull. We opted for the more expensive Geyser Peak Cab Sauv ($45) and it was much, much better. Definitely worth the difference in price. If you're only up for a glass or two though, then you should probably opt for a different red, or perhaps a white.SERVICE: Pretty great service. Our entrees were kind of rushed out to us after the appetizer, and we ended up sticking around for a while in order to finish off the bottle. They also didn't charge us full price on the one scoop of Gelato that we wanted, which was noticed and appreciated.PRICE: Standard for a more upscale type restaurant, but I feel like their pasta dishes are slightly overpriced. This isn't unique to Locale though. A LOT of places mark up their pasta dishes, which is pretty silly when you think about how much the actual ingredients cost. For their salmon, steak, and chicken dishes, I understand the pricing.

We Been before but Monique (maybe is spelled differently ) she was ..is great fast service really nice we love her :),
"First impression walking in the door was ""WOW"". There are beautiful people and everyone is a chipper hipster.Sat down and ordered my meal. The service was ok, not the best. I felt with the amount of staff they had the service shouldve been better. There was a different person serving the drinks, maybe they have an in-house Sommelier???Appetizers: Cheese platter- was nothing specialCalamari - was ok but nothing spectacular very small portionMain Course:Branzino - who serves this by the Filet?? You serve the entire fish!!! How do you know what you are getting. They can be serving any white fish and you wouldn't know! Very disappointing.Short Ribs with risotto - this was a bigger joke. If someone orders short ribs, they are expecting actually cuts of beef! what they brought me was broken bits of short ribs over risotto. The menu is misleading. Instead of writing short ribs, you should change it to kibbles of short ribs, because there was no sign of any meat.I thought it was cute that they sprinkled a little blue cheese over the dish.Please rename this dish ""Risotto with short ribs drippings""The decor is nice, come here to drink and nibble on small plates. They make nice cocktails and a nice winelist.I ended up having a second dinner a couple of blocks away.Very dissapointed."," ?Appetizers: Cheese platter- was nothing specialCalamari - was ok but nothing spectacular very small portionMain Course:Branzino - who serves this by the Filet??

"Have been meaning to come here for a while and we showed up without a reservation on a Sunday at noon. Thankfully, there were two seats at the bar that we were able to sit at. If we come back, we will definitely make a reservation as the bar can get quite cramped. We ordered the California Benedict which was perfectly cooked and the French toast was sinfully sweet in the best way. Definitely recommend getting the home fries on the side, the portions are a little on the small side in comparison to brunch places nearby."," Have been meaning to come here for a while and we showed up without a reservation on a Sunday at noon If we come back, we will definitely make a reservation as the bar can get quite cramped.

"One of my favorite dinner spots whenever I don't feel like cooking. I've had here : Grilled Swordfish, Pasta Bolognese and Black Angus steak.Grilled Swordfish tasted ok, didn't know what to expect or how it should taste since I've never had swordfish. Honest to god it just tasted like lean fish. It was served with some fried onions but overall found it a little salty.Pasta Bolognese was about what you would expect, I was kinda wasted for that so I don't remember too much. Black angus steak was delicious, came precut with fries and argula on the side. I loved all of it, but again the meat as just slightly too salty. Overall everything here is just a little too salty but very fresh, well cooked and well executed.I'd also like to note that this is a great place for a date, it's usually very quiet with dim lighting and low music. There is outdoor seating if you'd like and the street is typically pretty quiet. If you come here with a date, expect to walk out with a $80-100 bill before tip. Drinks here aren't cheap and neither is the food but the service is excellent, the food but is well done and overall Locale is probably one of the better restaurants in Astoria."," I've had here : Grilled Swordfish, Pasta Bolognese and Black Angus steak.Grilled Swordfish tasted ok, didn't know what to expect or how it should taste since I've never had swordfish.

I would recommend the Nutella 'stuffed' Texas toast.The only down side is it seems they have a small kitchen and staff, it was a little bit of a wait to get out food and the restaurant wasn't even half full.

"Holy smokes!  The owner has no clue how to deal with customers.Let me start by saying this was hands down, one of my favorite restaurants in Astoria, despite the spotty service speed...But tonight we experienced a new low in customer service! (not from our waitress, but from the owner himself.)We showed up and, as usual, informed the waitress that my wife has a gluten allergy and is lactose intolerant.  We were immediately put at ease, as the menu specifies that they carry gluten free pasta, and the waitress seemed to understand.  She told us she would ask the chef himself to make sure anything we ordered was GF.  My wife asked if the shrimp dish was GF and the waitress said she wasn't sure, but she'd ask the chef.  She then returned to confirm that we were in the clear,  but when it came out the yucca appeared to be deep fried.  (not everyone knows this, but folks with gluten allergies have varying levels of sensitivity, and contamination can even occur by using the same deep fryer as one that might have had gluteny items in it.  upon viewing the beautifully fried yucca strips, my suspicions were stirred, so we beckoned the waitress and asked if she was sure these yucca were not fried in a deep fryer.  She admitted that she was not sure and went down to confirm with the chef.  When she returned she said that there had been a mix up in the order, and they had given us one that had been prepared with butter.  While that was not great, it wasn't our main concern.  The Gluten is the big issue.  So she talked to the manager, who came by and said the dish was ""100% Gluten Free"", but I had to be sure, so I explained to him about the deep fryer situation, and he seemed enlightened and said he would be back.   This is when the owner came to us.   We calmly explained the situation, and he admitted that the yucca was in fact fried in the same deep fryer that they fry everything else in, and he offered to get her a replacement meal.  At this point we didn't really have any faith that the chef understood Gluten issues, so we said ""no thank you.""  I then- completely calmly and politely, told the owner that Locale is one of my favorite restaurants, and we love coming there, but we can't if they don't understand the complexities of GF cooking.  He argued that they carry GF pasta and she should have ordered that.We calmly explained that she ordered a dish that the chef said was GF.  He argued that we should have read that it was fried on the menu.  (which, for the record, the menu didn't specify)I told him that the chef claimed it was GF, but we understand that he may not have realized that the fryer could contaminate, but they really should know that.  (At this point we were ready to just pay for what we had eaten and cut our losses.)I mentioned BareBurger as an example of a place that has a dedicated deep fryer for GF customers.He got really upset about this and told us Bareburger doesn't use organic meat, and ""do you know who my chef is?"" he continued, ""bareburger, bleh!""  and then he implied that they don't actually use a dedicated deep fryer.Around this point, I got tired of arguing and told him that now he was simply insulting us.  whatever happened to ""the customer is always right""?  We argued until I told him I wasn't going to pay for anything and he just walked away.I went over to our waitress and tipped her, as she had clearly done nothing wrong.  and when the manager came by with the bill, I told hem we weren't going to pay.  So then the owner comes up again and says ""what do you think you're trying to pull?""I told him we didn't intend on paying considering the horrendous customer service we had experienced.  To which he threatened to call the police.  I said I would pay if that was the case, and then he went to get the bill, but then reconsidered, and told us, ""just get out of my restaurant and stop bothering my customers.  We don't want your business.  Idiots.""And so we left.  There were in fact many customers that looked mortified at the whole ordeal, and even one who told us she was a celiac and could not believe the owner's attitude.Anyway, the whole thing was so absurd it was kind of funny.  And I'm really sad that I can clearly never return to this restaurant that has such a great atmosphere, and delicious food. (for those of us not concerned with allergies)  I feel truly sorry for the staff that works for this guy.  In the end, all he had to say was ""I'm sorry, we didn't realize, is there anything we can do to fix this?""  but apparently that would require him to swallow his clearly not gluten-free pride!"," She told us she would ask the chef himself to make sure anything we ordered was GF.

"What a let down for brunch!Came here to Locale with my friend Chris a few weeks ago to try it out and was really disappointed with the overall experience. The Low Points:-Took forever to get someone to take our order (10 minutes when you're hungry is an eternity)-Took forever to get our food (I only complain because there were people who sat down after us getting theirs before us plus it wasn't a full house by any means)-Food was obviously just sitting out as it was barely lukewarm-The ""special"" was a sad sight to behold with 2 thin slices of chicken breast with 5 pieces of broccoli and 5 pieces of cut baby potatoes-The food honestly reminded me of airplane food (you know, THAT taste)-Took forever to get the checkOh and for the icing on the cake, the ""special"" Chicken Marsala turned out to be $17.99 and the credit card minimum was something stupid like $20 (I hate that crap!) so we couldn't split our bill as planned. Only positive thing I can say is that we were able to get 10% off the bill using the Yelp app. And the waitress was nice. But meh, the rest left a bad taste in my mouth. Literally. I really had wanted to come here for dinner originally but after my experience with brunch that won't be happening.Bottom line: Both of us left hangry and I won't be coming back since there are TONS of better options on 30th Avenue that offer much better food deals for brunch *cough* William Hallet *cough* Queens Comfort *cough*"," The Low Points:-Took forever to get someone to take our order (10 minutes when you're hungry is an eternity)-Took forever to get our food (I only complain because there were people who sat down after us getting theirs before us plus it wasn't a full house by any means)-Food was obviously just sitting out as it was barely lukewarm-The ""special"" was a sad sight to behold with 2 thin slices of chicken breast with 5 pieces of broccoli and 5 pieces of cut baby potatoes-The food honestly reminded me of airplane food (you know, THAT taste)-Took forever to get the checkOh and for the icing on the cake, the ""special"" Chicken Marsala turned out to be $17.99 and the credit card minimum was something stupid like $20 (I hate that crap!) so we couldn't split our bill as planned.

"Locale is the kind of place that presents a serious dilemma: Do I come here for dinner or do I come here for drinks at the bar and lounge area? This review is for the former as I was feeling the hunger pains and so opted for a table for two.The decor is definitely easy on the eyes, creating a sense of intimacy that's perfect for conversation and relaxation. Candles ( the real type, not the battery operated), high ceiling, high windows with white drapes create an almost urban gothic setting. While the menu offers up many Italian dishes there's also a selection of other fare, such as crab cake appetizer, cornish hen and salmon. We started with an appetizer of fried calamari.I liked the fact that I could see actual slices of garlic in the dipping sauce. I didn't like salty taste of the fried calamari. Fortunately water refills were plentiful and overall service was spot on.Up next was my main course of pappardelle and lamb ragu. My first glance of the plate caused some confusion as there seemed to be some serious ingredient separation. In the left corner, I give you ragu! And in the right corner, pappardelle! And as referee a large clump of goat's cheese...ding ding ding, let's get ready to eat!Fortunately I was able to stir it all up and the result of my labor was delicious. So delicious that I was scraping my plate in the hope that some more could magically appear.On a serious note, the portion did tend towards the small end of the spectrum and I observed the same with my wife's cornish hen so an appetizer is recommended.With room left for dessert, we decided to share an order of the apple nutella cobbler. The tragedy of this dessert is that it becomes more seductively good the closer it is towards disappearing from the face of this earth-- in other words, when the warmth of the cobbler melts the scoop of ice cream that then blends in with the nutella towards the bottom creating a swirling dervish of delectable delight. Stepping away from the preceding sentence, I do wish that there was a bit more noticeable nutella flavor on top so my first few bites would not be in vain. That's a very minor critique and in no way interfered with the enjoyment of this dish.The appetizer, two entrees, dessert and a soda came to $60. If I return to this part of Astoria, I'd have to do the locale-motion again.(Choose whatever version you prefer)"," enjoy This review is for the former as I was feeling the hunger pains and so opted for a table for two.The decor is definitely easy on the eyes, creating a sense of intimacy that's perfect for conversation and relaxation.

"3 thumbs up (if I had an extra one!).  After contemplating about coming here for nearly 2 years now, I finally set a day and time to come here...and it was completely worth the wait!  It was a Monday nite, the place was nearly empty and to ourselves.  I figured it would be quiet since it was the day before New Years Eve and just a few days after Christmas.  This place got packed by the time we left.  Who would of thought! We started the nite with drinks at the bar.  I highly enjoyed the passion martini and also the pumpkin pie martini but it got to be a little too sweet by the time I was done.  For my main course, I had the beef short rib risotto.  One word to describe it - AMAZING!  It didn't seem like much on the plate but it was very rich and the beef just melted in your mouth.  They really did a great job on this dish.  Oh, I forgot about the appetizer.  I had the calamari but this wasn't just any calamari.  The roasted jalapeno peppers that accompanied the dish was great.  A bit spicy (obviously) so me and the wife nibbled on it.  By the time dinner was done, I didn't have any space for desert.  Of course the wifey ordered it.  I was already satisfied.  It was Christmas all over again!  Summary:1. Great food/drinks2. Great service3. Great prices4. One hell of a timeCan't wait to come back and try their brunch menu.  Thanks Locale."," enjoy After contemplating about coming here for nearly 2 years now, I finally set a day and time to come here...and it was completely worth the wait!

"Bad choice for cold weather.The entrance hall added to the front door has one fatal flaw which the restaurant management seems to have missed. It also needs a door in order to create a closed space to prevent the cold air from rushing into the restaurant hall. The one at Locale does not and as a result every time some one opens the main entrance door the seated guests are blasted with arctic air. Needless to say this does not bode well for the cozy dining experience .We came to Locale  when it was a balmy 50F outside.

I think if it wasn't for the miserable cold that we experienced for the duration of our meal i would rate this place at 4 stars as the interior is bright and pleasant and the food, while not spectacular, is good enough to come back for."," Bad choice for cold weather.The entrance hall added to the front door has one fatal flaw which the restaurant management seems to have missed.

Had an awesome brunch here Sunday.   Had no trouble making a reservation.   The service was great and the two picky pregnant women at the table were well taken care of by our server. The food was awesome and the menu was so interesting it was difficult to choose what to order.   The Texas toast was amazing.   Everyone loved what they had.   I will be back., Had an awesome brunch here Sunday Had no trouble making a reservation The service was great and the two picky pregnant women at the table were well taken care of by our server.

"We went there for a 4 course new years eve dinner. The restaurant was very small yet cozy and nicely decorated for NYE.  They gave us complementary hats, noisemakers and champagne toast at midnight. The staff and ambience was superb, the food was mediocre. Although they said it was an Italian restaurant, it had a lot of French contemporary flare to it. Risotto ball- it was complimentary. The outside was crisp and the inside was soft and risotto was soft and perfectly cooked.Scallops- it needed a sear. They were small and it it came with nice potato purée with mushrooms. Although the puree was good, there an excess of it that it was unproportional to the small 6-8 scallops. Gnocchi with pumpkin sauce- great, it was very creamy. It might have needed a tad bit more sauce. Spaghetti with lamb sauce- the spaghetti itself was amazing. It had great texture and it tasted house made. However I was not expecting the sauce to have shredded lamb, I thought it was going to be ground lamb. Either way, the lamb ruined the sauce and it tasted  very gamey. Roasted duck breast- it was ok, it needed a sear and it was a little chewy. The polenta was very salty, I think it was the breadcrumbs. The foie gras even before I found out what it was, I could just feel the fat particles bouncing off my tongue. Although it was done decently, the texture was too blood curling rich for me.Bass- It also needed a sear. There were 2 other components with it, one of them was fried salted cod and also a lump of fried pancetta. Both of these elements made the overall dish too salty.ricotta cheese cake- very good.chocolate caramel pudding- I thought it was too chocolatey, even with the ice cream and I love my share of chocolate. It was more of a dense brownie. I was expecting a lava cake. Overall, it was a nice place for us to go to for last minute New Years Eve that was close to home."," The restaurant was very small yet cozy and nicely decorated for NYE.

"Locale may be one of my favorite Astoria restaurants...I absolutely loved my experience.First, the space is really cute.  Floor to ceiling windows, dimly lit, cute bar and outside seating.  The service was good.  We waited a while for an outside table even though there were a few open (which bugged me a bit), but everyone was very nice.  Our server was great and was willing to give me a dinner suggestion.The food was fantastic.  For an appetizer we got the Bruschetta Trio and we loved it.For an entree, I got the chicken special which was chicken stuffed with mozzarella and spinach and wrapped with bacon and it was amazing.  My boyfriend got the Lamb Ragu with whipped goat cheese...they had me at whipped goat cheese!Now I have to go back to try the brunch!"," Locale may be one of my favorite Astoria restaurants...I absolutely loved my experience.First, the space is really cute.

"Astoria Revisited Locale is like Astoria. It's snug in parts and means well yet never makes you feel like your missing out either.If I still lived in Astoria, would I drive there and lose my spot when I could go to Vesta or the Astor Bake Shop instead, no, of course not. That's like blowing off those cheap, easy to slam posh blond twins from Basketball Diaries in exchange for a wannabe, more bug eyed,  Zooey Deschanel.But if I lived closer to Kaufman Studios or god for bid got a staff writer job for Nurse Jackie when it was filmed there,  I'd revisit Locale to see if all the Yelp hype was justified or just another example of wannabe Queens hipsters pumping up a so so brunch spot in order to feel better about their locale. I got a bloody marry with a half broken straw which made it harder to suck through. It was like my wife giving me a taste of my own medicine after I drank too much the night before during our free from baby time together which was why I ordered the Bloody Mary in the first place. In general, now that I'm older and have a kid, brunch destination spots don't provide much of a thrill anymore, especially when I jack up the bill by over ordering for my daughter as a lame disguise to sample more side options for myself.  Plus, that big backed, 5'8 Hipster bartender that thinks her heavily tattooed arm gives her the right  to let her arm fat dangle like she's walking the dog doesn't make me hot and bothered in terms of me thinking I still gotta have her in my arms as I launch her up and down my cast iron clad, pogo stick.  This is the type of review you get after I watch Dice's new Showtime special, Invincible. The rap song in honor of Dice at the end is the best part by the way. Now, I'm also real strong at creating and making my own omelettes so unless your serving crisp, non clumpy  hash browns, not the case here, have fresh squeezed OJ that's squeezed from Brooklyn Decker's nipples or make the most mouth watering, respectable pork alternative such as home made sage turkey sausage, I'm not going to lose any sleep over missing out on the peak-less ride.  Having a boorish brunch these days when you consider  all the recipe knowledge at your finger tips is like having boring sex with woman that were taught Sex -Ed on Bang Bus. You take one dip in those still , lifeless waters and think:  ""What a waste of bait.  But that's your fault for hooking up with a such a boring slob in the first place, oh!""                                                                        The End"," It's snug in parts and means well yet never makes you feel like your missing out either.If I still lived in Astoria, would I drive there and lose my spot when I could go to Vesta or the Astor Bake Shop instead, no, of course not.

"We live right near this place and walk by it every day, but never made it in. We were craving brunch, so decided to finally give it a try. We ordered eggs Benedict with Canadian bacon and a salad + an egg white omelet with baby spinach & mushrooms with a side of salad. The side salad was very good and complemented the light dishes perfectly. We don't drink caffeine, so we asked for decaf and were surprised by how delicious it was! The service was friendly, but a bit lacking since they were busy and apparently shorthanded. Totally reasonable prices. Not a crazy amount of selection, but I have a feeling the items they do offer are all high quality.

"Nom nom! What a delightful little gem in Astoria! I loved the atmosphere (huge, floor-to-ceiling windows), our waitress was delightful, and ohmygosh the food. We came for brunch, and for a modest $8, I enjoyed the cornflake-crusted Texas toast with fruit and syrup. It. Was. Awesome. The mimosa was good too, as was the coffee (and bacon!

"Decided to check this place out this morning for a solo brunch. All-around everything was pretty good that hit my table. No real complaints about the food and I'd describe it as above-average brunch food. Coffee was great, and my omelette was cooked well, though light on seasoning. My bigger issues were with the service - It took about 8-10 min to be greeted, and another 10 min to get my coffee. That was a bit frustrating. Also, I originally wanted to order the Lamb Hash Benedict on the menu, which was not available that day, at which point I was told about the special (doesn't that usually happen before you order?), which didn't sound so appetizing. That was very disapppointing as it was the only out-of-the-box thing on the menu, which is usually what appeals to me."," Decided to check this place out this morning for a solo brunch All-around everything was pretty good that hit my table.

"I don't know how it took me so long to try this place out given its trendy ambiance and alluring outdoor seating, but I finally made it for brunch this morning with a friend. We were seated right away with none of the typical Astoria wait at noon. I have to say I was extremely pleased with the experience. My friend and I ordered the goat cheese and baby spinach omelette with home fries and the belgian waffles with berries and cream to share, and both were delicious beyond my expectations. I think they might put some almond extract into the whipped cream; it definitely has something extra to it which makes it unbelievably tasty. The service was great and the prices were much more reasonable than I expected; I think with tip and tax we ended up spending about $13 each.

"We ended up here on a Saturday night after I screwed up and didn't make reservations at one of our usual places. I try and not be that guy to write something off after only visiting once, but I will not be visiting Locale again and figure I would share my experience since it seems that many people have strong positive feelings about this restaurant. The best thing about this place was the decore. I have a feeling that a lot of people enjoy being seen here, rather than eating, as the food and service was definitely subpar when it comes to what you can find in Astoria. First off, the two dishes I wanted (the duck, a special, and the cornish hen, a menu staple) were already no longer available at 8:00pm. - Bottle of champagne took 20 minutes to reach our table, because the 'bar tender was really swamped'. It arrived under chilled. - My fiance's hanger steak arrived cool, the sides of mashed potatoes and broccoli were actually cold. Sauce was served on the steak, when we asked for it off. - Lamb ragu with goat cheese. Where to start. How do you overpower lamb flavor with sauce? Make a awful sauce that stayed with my taste buds for the rest of the night. This was honestly one of the worst dishes I have ever paid for. The staff was apologetic because 'the restaurant was so swamped on a Saturday night'. There were tables open, and we were seated immediately. I shouldn't have to suffer at a restaurant because there are other people eating there. This place is expensive enough and should have their act together. My biggest regret was not calling earlier to make a reservation at Trattoria Vesta, which blows this place out of the water on all accounts."," enjoy I try and not be that guy to write something off after only visiting once, but I will not be visiting Locale again and figure I would share my experience since it seems that many people have strong positive feelings about this restaurant.

"Solid brunch spot in this area. I didn't have to wait for a table which was awesome, and we grabbed a table by the windows which was nice. They have a bunch of options for eggs Benedict which I really appreciate since they are my absolute favorite brunch dish. I went with the Avocado and Tomatoe Benedict which were good, and I tried the Portobello one which I actually liked better. The hollandaise was a tiny bit too buttery but maybe I'm just being picky.My only complaint would be that the orange juice I ordered was 80% ice and 20% orange juice... not cool! And also for a french place they should have MUCH better coffee.", Solid brunch spot in this area And also for a french place they should have MUCH better coffee.

"I truly adore this place. It was our go-to brunch spot when my boyfriend lived nearby, it had just the perfect atmosphere whether you were vaguely hungover or perky and ready to tackle the day. Plus, their eggs benedict (in varying flavors/styles) are always spot freakin' on. Then about a year ago we went for dinner and now I'm even more hooked. They really know how to make good, flawless food. The seating is a bit weird (big deep benches in some areas) so for short people like me it can be a bit awkward, but the food is so tasty I don't really care. Also their mimosa selection is nice. Oh and their cheese polenta - order it. Die. Go to heaven immediately."," The seating is a bit weird (big deep benches in some areas) so for short people like me it can be a bit awkward, but the food is so tasty I don't really care.

"Yes, it's true: I really like this place. No, it's not grimy and no, it's not that cheap. But still, it's one of the cooler, more hip spots in the area (especially during the summer) and the food is great.During the warmer months they take down the walls and completely open up the front, which is a nice touch. The service is tops and the staff always knows how to bump the tunes (ex: an entire Scissor Sisters album). Both brunch and dinner are excellent, but I prefer brunch. The portions are large and the menu is always changing, so make sure you ask about the specials. They have a unique selection of cocktails, but they come at a high price. There's no beer on tap, which is a bummer, but you can't go wrong with icy cold tap water.Note: restaurant.com offers discounted dinner gift certificates but they do not work!

"The gist: Waited nearly an hour for three appetizers while restaurant was half-empty. Others seated after our arrival served before us. Prejudice or ineptitude?  My fiancé, his family and I stopped by this evening for dinner as it was one of the few local restaurants open on July 4th and seemed to have a charming ambiance. Evidently appearances aren't everything. We were seated quickly enough and our waitress seemed friendly, but we were left waiting nearly 45 minutes for the first order placed from our table: a glass of Coke. (Oddly enough, the two glasses of wine we ordered at around the same time appeared a mere five minutes after placing the initial order. I'm at a loss to explain how pouring Coke into a glass is somehow more complex and time-consuming than pouring wine into two glasses.) We ordered three simple appetizers that would be considered standard fare for even the no-frillsiest of dive bars--specifically, meatballs, calamari and a small Caesar salad. After waiting forty-five minutes for these orders and the Coke, my fiancé finally went into the restaurant to inquire, and was told the drink would be coming out shortly, and the appetizers in another ten minutes at most. Though again I'd be hard pressed to explain how the preparation of three appetizers could possibly require the better part of an hour, especially when the establishment is nowhere near full capacity, this element of our experience alone isn't what prompted this negative review. It's the fact that when we arrived at around 7:45 p.m., we were the only ones seated outside (at our request, so as to enjoy the weather). Two other parties--both couples on dates, it seemed--arrived between 7:45 and 8:30 (when our first order came) and were sat outside as well. As we fruitlessly awaited our appetizers, we were astonished to see that both these tables received both their drinks and food before we did, despite both arriving and placing their orders significantly later. I will also note that we were the only minorities at the establishment--make of that what you will. I hesitate to ascribe anything to bald-faced bigotry, especially in a neighborhood as diverse as Astoria, but it was either that or sheer incompetence at the root of our experience. Either way, I'm not coming back. P.S. Those long-awaited appetizers were mediocre."," enjoy Prejudice or ineptitude My fiancé, his family and I stopped by this evening for dinner as it was one of the few local restaurants open on July 4th and seemed to have a charming ambiance.

"The food is delicious, the service is professional and attentive, and the space is beautiful. My friends and I stumbled upon this place after finding the crepe place we had intended to go for brunch on Sunday was closed. We were so pleased with this place, despite being full from Nutella stuffed Texas toast and the best cheddar cheese omelette I ever had, we still ordered dessert. I also had the hot chocolate - I know it's a small thing but it was great. Real milk hot chocolate! Amazing. My friends and I had nothing but good things to say about this place, their very friendly staff, and the beautiful layout. My friends are both designers and so their approval is hard to come by.

"I ate at Locale yesterday for my roommate's birthday dinner. I have walked past it several times and have always been tempted to eat there, but since dieting lately, I didn't think I could do it healthfully, and boy was I wrong. My friend Jen and I both had the portabello mushroom and roasted red pepper arugula salad with toasted goat cheese. I, however, also started with a soup because I hadn't had much else to eat throughout the day. The soup was pasta e fagioli. My roommate had the squid ink pasta. Jen and my roommate also both had sangria. For dessert, I had a poached pear (no ice cream, no puff pastry, no whipped cream), the birthday girl had what they called Bomba (like the Israeli snack in flavor profile but actually ice cream and chocolate), and Jen had the chocolate cake. I was really happy with the soup in terms of tomato flavor, but was disappointed in the broth to ingredient ratio. There was too much pasta (so I didn't eat it all). I did, however, like the garlic that had softened in the soup. As for the salad, I thought it was great. Really earthy tasting with the arugula and portabello combination. The bill was under $100 for 3 of us, which for a restaurant of this quality, in service and in food, is fairly reasonable. I'd definitely come back, especially for a nice occasion."," I have walked past it several times and have always been tempted to eat there, but since dieting lately, I didn't think I could do it healthfully, and boy was I wrong.

"stopped in Locale on a Saturday at 9:30 and was able to sit down without a reservation.  They gave us a comfy table for two in the back elevated area that was very cozy.  There was a small party of about 12 next to us that had a few very loud guests but whatever they eventually left.   place is nice looking, exposed brick and iron feel with tin ceilings and antiquely wall coverings.  its not very big so has a nice ""locale"" vibe.  the waitress was very friendly and bubbly, she seems like she was auditioning for a broadway show but it was somewhat entertaining and she was nice.  we started with a couple of glasses of pinot noir that i didnt like at all. i switched to the petite syrah that was much better. they gave a nice basket of focaccia and olive oil.  for app we shared the artichoke ravioli in truffle cream.  fairly simple dish but very tasty.  generous portion also, more than enough to split for an app.  i had the veal scallopini, it was served with mushrooms kale and some dumplings in a red wine truffle sauce.  my date had a chicken special which was stuffed with mushroom and wrapped in bacon.  both were very good.   skipped dessert.  overall a very pleasant dinner.  one pasta, one veal, one chicken and 4 glasses of wine was $95 i dont know that there is much more on the menu i would run back for, i didnt really see any other entrees that i was interested in.  there was a duck special that i guess they ran out of i would have tried if they had it.   i dont eat fish so i would like to see more meat options in the entree section.  they do offer quite a few pastas that sound good.  so i wouldnt have any problem going back.  and maybe ill will try the brunch."," They gave us a comfy table for two in the back elevated area that was very cozy.

"Took my Mom here for dinner after a walk in Astoria Park. The exterior did initially draw us in, but the wait staff, host and food kept us. They offer pretty original food combinations and they were all delicious. we started with the trio bruschetta, we chose the hazelnut/honey, pineapple/chili and avocado- all really good. Mom had the fried gnocchi and I ordered the pasta with peas, prosciutto and zabaglione sauce. Really good! The serving sizes are smaller than the gluttonous sizes in most restaurant, but it is plenty and no waste of food. Great to sit outside, the street isn't too busy and the inside is also nice. Good to have lunch, brunch or dinner or to come for just a cheese plate and wine or coffee and desert. Highly recommended."," Took my Mom here for dinner after a walk in Astoria Park They offer pretty original food combinations and they were all delicious.

"FRIGGIN' AWESOME!My boyfriend and I were excited to go out and try a new Italian restaurant that had just opened in Astoria, which will remain nameless.  While we were there the food looked amazing, but the communication between the staff was terrible, after a few mistakes and hearing the couple stand up and say, ""After 30-minutes of waiting and they didn't once tell us it's cash only"", we departed.As we left, we bumped into that same couple and they said that they were going to Locale a few blocks away since they were set on Italian.  After getting a good whiff of garlic and cheese, we realized that ours were as well so we headed on over to 34th Ave and we were SOOOOO HAPPY we did.We arrived around 8 on a Friday night and we didn't have to wait as we opted to sit inside (most of the outside tables were taken as people enjoyed the weather).  They had ""The Godfather"" playing on the white brick wall behind the bar and we started to pick through the menu.  We got a bottle of wine, a crostino, veal meatballs, rigatoni with pork cheek, and pork chop.The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu.  Each plate kept getting better and better, but had we eaten the plates in reverse I would say the same.  They were all so delicious!  The burrata on the crostino was so rich and creamy.  The veal meatballs are indescribably tender and perfectly seasoned in a sweet traditional marinara.  The rigatoni had such a rich flavor between the jowl and the onions.  And the pork chop, my word!  It was perfectly cooked and on a bed of broccoli rabe and cannellini beans.  The flavors were amazing!  I wish I had a food critique's repertoire of food adjectives that I could use other than amazing because I don't know how else to describe it.The atmosphere was nice, relaxed, and unpretentious.  We ended up closing the restaurant portion down as we enjoyed our delicious Sirah and none of the staff bothered to rush us out, but let us enjoy our time there.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and they are even starting a movie night on Tuesdays with half-priced bottles of wine.  We'll be going back this weekend to enjoy another feast with our friends visiting from out of town.Thanks Locale!"," enjoy FRIGGIN' AWESOME!My boyfriend and I were excited to go out and try a new Italian restaurant that had just opened in Astoria, which will remain nameless.

I was looking to host a surprist bridal shower for a close friend. I attempted to make a reservation 3 times before it was acutally completed. I asked if they had a pre-fix brunch menu available for group. They said yes, but they didn't know what it was and they would get back to me. They never got back to me.I had to call several times to get an answer about that. I was finally instructed by the manager that I should pick six items off the current menu, anything except the skirt steak and we would recieve unlimited mimosas, bloody marys, coffee, and tea for $40. I thought that was a little high so I asked if we could get 4 options with unlimited drinks for $35 - no, couldn't do it. Ok - fine. So I then chose my six items, to which the manager replied two of the six items were not available. Why say pick any six if you didn't mean it? Then I asked for savory vegatarian options, the manager replied with two meat filled choices - come on. Fast forward to the morning of - I called around 11 am letting them know that we would only have 10 instead of the intended 15 for our 1:30 reservation. The hostess who I spoke with said thank you for calling - no problem. 5 minutes later my phone rings with the manager asking me if I was cancelling the reservation. I said no I'm not cancelling, I'm letting you know that we will not be as many as originally thought. He told me that I couldn't do that in the future but this time he would let it slide. At no point was I informed that they needed 72 hours notice on adjusting the reservation. Seriously?! I'm freeing up space for you in advance and I get an attitude. I arrive around 1:15 and grab a seat at the bar because our space wasn't ready yet. No worries - I was early. So the table is ready at 1:30 and I begin setting up. We expect the bride to arrive around 2. So the other guests arrive and we order some tea and coffee. The bride ended up being delayed in the city so she didn't arrive until 2:30. I appreciate that it was later than I had said it would be. I didn't appreciate the manager and a waitress repeated pestering me about when would the rest of the party be arriving. The restuarant is busy but no one is waiting for a table at this point. Is it really that serious?The bride arrives - we surprise her - Yay! We all order within the next 5 minutes and get down to enjoying our unlimited beverages and the company. Our waitress is bringing our drinks and proceeds to spill 6 mimosas down the bride's back. After many apologies and a hair dryer in the bathroom, we continued to celebrate and ordered another round of drinks.35 minutes later - our drinks arrive and the waitress tells me that the unlimited portion of our event is over as per the manager. Ok - I'm really not unreasonable but come on - you spill multiple drinks down the back of the guest of honor, replace them 35 minutes later, and then you tell me we're done?! So I ask for the check.The manager brings the check and asks if we want anything else - more drinks? dessert? No thank you - I'll take my overpriced average brunch bill and go. Needless to say I will not be returning. This is not the place for group or a reasonable brunch"," enjoy Food was ok, decor was very charming, service was terrible.

"Food was OK but a few things really let the dining experience down.1. White wine was warm - they said they had problems with their refrigerator but still served it to us. For this the service gets a B.2. They brought the main meals when we were clearly still on our appetizers. They looked embarrassed when we glanced up wondering what they were doing there but they proceed sheepishly anyway. For this the service gets a B-3. Four of us at a table but they insist on leaning over me, placing their armpit in my face as they serve the person next to me. Would it kill them to make the extra three steps? For this the service gets a CAll in all - amateur night in great decor. So many possibilities, so much promise, so little effort... Overall - rating? C"," For this the service gets a B.2.

"What struck me first was the design of the façade and interior: decidedly not Queens (or at least not the Queens I am used to). Locale has the ambiance of a cafe in Paris and adequate food. There is nothing on the menu that has ever disappoint my myself or my guests, but I usually stick to the eggs benedict. A safe choice. The coffee is strong and the servers are good. What more can you ask for?"," There is nothing on the menu that has ever disappoint my myself or my guests, but I usually stick to the eggs benedict.

"Me and 7 friends made a reservation at Locale when we learned that they recently changed management, and it was a great a great choice. You can always tell whether an Italian restaurant is any good by the quality of the staples - calamari, pasta, wine, etc. In all categories, Locale met par, and they really surprised with their cocktails and a few dishes, including the duck, the short ribs, the shaved brussel sprout salad, and the tortellini with braised beef. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place."," You can always tell whether an Italian restaurant is any good by the quality of the staples - calamari, pasta, wine, etc. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place."
"My fiancé and I just had our engagement party brunch here and it was AMAZING!!! The staff was awesome and the food was great!  I would recommend this place to anyone.  We had 56 guests and the owners were so accommodating and willing to make the day very special.  All of our guests were complimenting the outstanding service and food.  Our glasses were getting filled constantly and the food came out nice and hot for everyone!  They personalized the chalkboard for us, played a picture slideshow of us, and provided really cute photo props for each table for our guests to enjoy!  We forgot to get batteries for one of our marquee letters for decoration and one of the staff went out to get some!  Also one of our guests were picking at some left over calamari (because it was so good!!) and the owner came over and asked if she wanted more gnocchi (thinking she didn't get enough on her plate...which she did...she just really liked the calamari and the gnocchi is great too..my personal favorite).  They were so great and professional.  I am so glad we chose gastroteca.  Our day couldn't have been better!!

"Minus two stars for service. Minus one for food. The biggest plus here is that I got 10% off my bill by checking in on Yelp. Luckily I actually did get my bill after waiting 20+ minutes after I finished dinner. I acknowledge the restaurant did get busy, but if a server can't come to the table at least once every 15min, even just to refill water, I don't feel appreciated.I wanted to like this place more because it is very local (hah!), but I just couldn't. I am not a picky eater, at all, but the spaetzle and sauce with my pork scaloppini were just yuck. I've had spaetzle before, and it's been better. That said, my boyfriend did love his filet mignon and couldn't even finish it. I would come here for drinks because the bar looked pretty nice."," Minus two stars for service Minus one for food I acknowledge the restaurant did get busy, but if a server can't come to the table at least once every 15min, even just to refill water, I don't feel appreciated.I wanted to like this place more because it is very local (hah!

"Brunch here is excellent.  We had a very attentive waitress who was not too chatty (which I liked) and sat inside but next to a huge open wall onto the street - so virtually outside.  The decor is beautiful.  I was worried because the pictures looked so dark, but the whole place opens up for brunch and is full of sunlight.We had cheddar polenta, homefries (they use some rosemary rub which is unexpected but tasty), spinach goat cheese omelet, and I got a chocolate latte which was pretty delicious.The food was good, but the environment was even better.  A really nice place for brunch and awesome that you can make reservations online!"," We had a very attentive waitress who was not too chatty (which I liked) and sat inside but next to a huge open wall onto the street - so virtually outside.

"Living south of Broadway, I love having brunch at Locale. The menu is great (the drink menu as well), the food was very good, and the attention from both the staff and the owner was amazing.The corned beef hash eggs benedict was smashing, as was my drink, a red wine sangria based with Montepulciano (my favorite wine, it just so happens, for its fruity hints from the South of Italy). They have a 1,000 different teas, maybe literally. With so many choices, of course we spazzed and got decaf chamomile.We'd been pestered by a bee, attracted to our sweet sangria. Rather than bringing out the toxic raid bee killer extreme 2000, the owner was kind and wise enough to place a bowl of honey out which apparently did the trick.I've eaten here many times for brunch and dinner and I love it here. It's a local establishment (no puns on the name), the food is good and everyone who I've encountered who works here has been extremely friendly.The managers and owner seems extremely receptive to feedback and will go out of their way to make for an excellent dining experience.By the looks of other reviews, I'm not the only one who left happy and on a full stomach....maybe a little tipsy though.****4 stars for great brunch, ever changing dinner menu, beautiful interior decor, outdoor seating in the summer and friendly waiters and owner!

"Charm ,ambiance and quality in Queens! Plus no obnoxious scene! First off I am not a brunch person for the most part. There are many restaurants that just over charge because it is ""brunch"". But I had to get my massage and with my condition sitting is the most painful thing for me. After the distress my body was in at Taverna Kyklades (though the food was awesome) we decided I should not go out to eat  unless the restaurant has comfy chairs.So my husband was challenged to find some place that is clean and comfy and warm for me. For some reason I just never saw this or noticed at on Yelp though several Yelp friends have gone. As several other reviewers said I wish I had found it sooner.The reason I needed to get brunch and get my massage so early is (or at least early for me) is our money pit apartment still needed additional work. We had painters come that insisted that they come early. So I got up early for the massage (they came in early for me) they do not really have set hours they will be there if they have customers, so we needed to eat and do errands to stay out until they were finished in our apartment.I thought of Sugar Freak but really the brunch is all high fat and high sugar. There are no healthy choices at all. So my husband found Locale and I am so glad he did. He choose it based on the pictures on their web site of their comfy seating.If you are outside of New York reading this you might not realize that many if not most New York restaurants lack decor space and ambaience. It is stressful for me right now in my condition to deal with and isn't pleasant to go to most restaurants. In NY you pay for comfort. But at Locale the prices are reasonable.We went for brunch but I will go back and have lunch and dinner. The menu is limited but the food is so clean and appropriate for the space. There are so many restaurants that look clean but if you peak into the kitchen there is chaos and dirt. Not here it is really clean all around. I had a Salmon Omelet which was okay it didn't thrill me so I switched with my hubby who had eggs and cheddar cheese polenta. We split the yogurt parfait. He is not really a yogurt person. He said though it was better than any yogurt he's  ever had! It was as good as it looks in the pictures, better even! He loved the banana pudding at Sugar Freak and said that is more his speed. But that is all he liked there. He liked everything about Locale. I was surprised to see that it is not a scene.Very low Key vibe.Others mentioned it is a nice date spot. Which brings me to something we saw that was so adorable. We saw an elderly couple that looked to be in their 80's. They were holding hands on a date. They were so cute! It is a great date spot or place to talk with friends. There were specials not on the menu on line as well as regulars ordering past specials not on the menu and the chef accommodated them.I am really charmed and look forward to going back soon!"," Plus no obnoxious scene But I had to get my massage and with my condition sitting is the most painful thing for me.

"Ehhh I really want to like Locale. I really do. It's the place my friend treated me to on my birthday. It's the place I chose to have my first date with a special lady and I enjoyed tons of good companys here. The place is hip. There's an elevated corner lounge that's great for large, private parties. The full bar stretches itself across the room. It felt like a bar with an extended dining area and outside seating. The waitresses were endearing. The bigger the expectations though, the more harsh I seem to be on reviews. The food wasn't very tastey. I had the Locale burger, medium rare. It came too rare for my taste and it was one of those really mushy burgers. I prefer my meat to have at least some bite to it. The drinks were alright. It doesn't justify the city-like costs though.You can find better options one more subway stop to broadway or better yet, two more to my hood at 30th ave.I am willing to give it another go and try something different on the menu - but am I just in denial?"," enjoy I really do It came too rare for my taste and it was one of those really mushy burgers.

"A little on the expensive side. My girlfriend and I ordered 2 glasses of wine, 2 entrees, 2 deserts, 1 appetizer and an aperitif and it all cost less than $125.  So judge the prices by that.The service was incredible.  The waiter we had was an extremely knowledgeable in both the menu items and the bar items.  He was also extremely charismatic and persuasive, often saying, why not? when we were offered more drinks and desert. The man must also have the patience of a saint.  As we were leaving some b**ch, who was apparently allergic to everything under the sun was complaining that the restaurant was running out of some of its evening specials and practically everything offered on the menu she was allergic to. Well that's what happens when you go to dinner at 11 pm on a Saturday night, what a horse's a**. The food was excellent.  I ordered the steak special, served with fried onions and mashed potatoes.  The only thing I was disappointed with was that the steak was cut  up into slices, I was hoping for a slab of steak.  The cherry cobbler was amazing! I highly recommend it."," A little on the expensive side So judge the prices by that.The service was incredible. when we were offered more drinks and desert The man must also have the patience of a saint As we were leaving some b**ch, who was apparently allergic to everything under the sun was complaining that the restaurant was running out of some of its evening specials and practically everything offered on the menu she was allergic to.

"Decent food.  Terrible service.  We had a party of 12 with reservations ahead of time.  Yet when we got there they still had some setup to do.  Fine.  But then it got worse.Super slow with everything, had to ask for extra place settings and water several times.  They were SO stingy with bread and olive oil it was ridiculous.  We had to ask for the same things about 4 times, and some of what we asked for never made it to the table.Took forever to get the appetizers, and waited about another half an hour or more between when appetizers finished to when entrees came.Here are some of the good and bad:Good:- meatballs - tender, juicy, flavorful- wild mushroom ravioli - good, not spectacular- calamari - nicely battered and fried- squid ink linguine - good balance of flavors- lamb pappardelle - again, good, but not spectacular.  Too much pasta to meat in proportionsBad:- Mayan shrimp with yucca - shrimp was DOUSED in seasoning.  strong, heavy, salty seasoning that completely masked the delicateness of the shrimp.  The yucca was hard and dry.- beef short rib risotto.  Who the hell chops short ribs into small cubes?  The flavor was good but the main ingredient was in small pieces and missing from the dish, and the consistency of the risotto was more like mashed potatoes- Grilled flank steak - meat was well seasoned, by dry and chewy.  With all of the ""organic, free range"" ingredients they say they use, that was NOT grass-fed beef we had at our table.I doubt I'll come back here again.  There are many other place with more consistent food and way better levels of service."," They were SO stingy with bread and olive oil it was ridiculous.

"I recently went to Locale for Saturday brunch with an amazing fashionista from the locale.  I was skeptical when she suggested it but decided to give it a try.  The place was kind of empty at about 3pm...The restaurant is a quaint open space...It has a nice ambiance about it.  I can see it being a cozy candle lit place at night..I took one star off because they sat us near the door in the winter in an otherwise empty restaurant and it was drafty... I was also disappointed by the lack of a more comprehensive and inclusive brunch menu, but I took no stars off for that, as its not their fault that I have been spoiled by the Calle Ocho's of the world.I ordered Rigatoni from the Special's menu...It was in a wine sauce and it was fantastic.  I was more than impressed, especially since I was honestly expecting a bit of a train wreck.  The food was very well prepared and flavorful.  My dining partner ordered breakfast and her food seemed to be quite delicious and she stated several times that she had a great meal and commented on the home fries.  The server was attentive...but the place was not busy, so that wasn't too hard.  However, she always had a smile in her face and sunshine in her heart.I would definitely recommend Locale as a place to go for brunch if you are in the area and unsure of where to eat.  I was quite impressed with my entree...I would say skip the liquor if you are value conscious...but really, the food can hold its own with the best of them..."," I recently went to Locale for Saturday brunch with an amazing fashionista from the locale The place was kind of empty at about 3pm...The restaurant is a quaint open space...It has a nice ambiance about it.

I've yet to be disappointed.", enjoy
Had a late brunch here. It was a reasonable experience. My friend enjoyed her carbonara pasta. The burger was a little well done despite me asking for medium rare.

"I wished I came here sooner. The  atmosphere, the food, and the drinks make this restaurant the perfect place for a night out. Another wonderful date restaurant in Astoria! They have outdoor seating and there's a nice lounge like area with couches inside the restaurant as well. I had the crispy zucchini with marinara sauce for an appetizer. The zucchini are cut into really super skinny (think anorexic) shoe string fries. The waiter said that most people ate the zuchinni fries with their fingers like french fries, which I found difficult to do. One,  they gave me a substantial portion (two people could have shared this) and two, the fries are so skinny that they barely got any of sauce when I dipped them. I elected to dump them out onto the plate and poured the sauced over them. The zuchinni fries were really tasty. I didn't care for the fried calamari so much, as I thought it was a bit mushy.For my entree, I had the linguini with clams. It was delicious, but a little too salty. I had to down a couple glasses of water while eating it and then drank another couple glasses when I got home. The drinks were incredible. I loved my blood orange martini. It was sweet and a little tart. The blood orange flavor was out of this world. The pineapple mojito was beautifully delicious and I loved the heady mint scent coming from that drink.$85 for 2 drinks, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, tax, and tip."," Another wonderful date restaurant in Astoria The zucchini are cut into really super skinny (think anorexic) shoe string fries.

"Came across this place when looking for an Italian restaurant in Astoria to check out.  There is a small outdoor seating area in the front.  The inside is quaint with a small lounge area in the back and a nice bar on the side.We started with the fried zucchini appetizer which was surprisingly good.  Cut shoestring style and fried, served with a slightly sweet tomato sauce that went well with the slightly salty zucchini.For our entrees we ordered the shrimp and english pea risotto and the parpadelle and lamb ragu.  Both were nothing to write home about.  Average at best.  The risotto was on the bland side and the rice and just boring.  The parpadelle was on the boring side as well.  Both entrees left us wanting for more.  We were hoping the tasty appetizer was a sign of good things to come with our entrees but we were sadly mislead and left us no desire to return back to this restaurant."," There is a small outdoor seating area in the front The inside is quaint with a small lounge area in the back and a nice bar on the side.We started with the fried zucchini appetizer which was surprisingly good.

"i really enjoy the interior decor and style of this place-- nothing spectacular, just nice and cozy, and good looking. it's a really nice spot to have drinks and/or dinner on a weekday night.i have had dinner at this place twice now, where i ordered the mushroom ravioli the first time and the artichoke ravioli the second time. i thought the mushroom ravioli was delicious, but the artichoke ravioli was just mediocre (too creamy, and the artichoke could've been fresher). great service both times (the waiter is quite memorable).get the calamari appetizer too, they make it crispy and tasty. p.s. music fans, they were playing this amazing nostalgic 90s indie/alternative playlist (think portishead, dinosaur jr., etc.) the second night i was there and i very much enjoyed that."," enjoy it's a really nice spot to have drinks and/or dinner on a weekday night.i have had dinner at this place twice now, where i ordered the mushroom ravioli the first time and the artichoke ravioli the second time. i thought the mushroom ravioli was delicious, but the artichoke ravioli was just mediocre (too creamy, and the artichoke could've been fresher). great service both times (the waiter is quite memorable).get the calamari appetizer too, they make it crispy and tasty."
"I have been to Locale twice, once for brunch and once for dinner. My experience each time was completely different. When I went for brunch, I absolutely fell in love.. The waitress, was probably one of the best waitresses I have ever had. unfortunately I do not remember her name but she was the most professional and most amicable waitress I have ever seen. I had the eggs benedict with canadian bacon and it was SO GOOD.  My dinner experience however was not so pleasant. After having such a enjoyable brunch experience I convinced my friends to go there for dinner for one of my friend's birthday. The waitress was alright, she was new so she wasn't as efficient as the previous waitress I had encountered at locale. As I mentioned the restaurant is very cute, it is a bit small but the ambiance is perfect. The food off of the dinner menu however, was rather disappointing. For appetizer, we had the the braised meatballs and the regular house salad with italian dressing. The meatballs where decent, the salad was probably something that should be served on the side for free. For our entree's we had the beef short rib risotto, which was VERY heavy and tasted like something you would find in a can of chef boyardee. We also had the organic chicken, which was very dry ( I mean how can you mess up chicken?), the toasted polenta and asparagus that is served with the chicken however was rather good. We also had the pappardelle & lamb ragu and the rigatoni bolognese, these were probably the largest disappointments of all the entrees. The pasta itself  in both dishes were VERY al dente, it was barely edible and as an Italian restaurant you would expect that you get good pasta.So basically, if you want to try locale go for brunch and stay away from the dinner menu!"," enjoy My experience each time was completely different. unfortunately I do not remember her name but she was the most professional and most amicable waitress I have ever seen.

"I went here a few times for dinner back in 2006 when I lived closer..came back a few months ago for brunch. I got a spinach and goat cheese omelette that was surprisingly good. Spinach omelettes often taste watery and too ""leafy"" but this was excellent.We got a side of cheddar polenta, which had way too much cheese in it. You could barely taste the polenta. My dining companion got eggs benedict, which were also cooked funny - not firm enough.When the check came, we happened to look at Yelp and noticed there was a 10% off deal. When I mentioned it to the waiter, she almost seemed offended. They made a whole production and went to talk to a manager. I never understand why places offer deals then get mad/surprised when people use them.After brunch (and paying), we were talking for a few more minutes and a guy came over and said ""waaaater?"" I declined. He then came over 5 minutes later and said ""waaaaaater?"" I declined again. I then went to use the bathroom, and on my way back he stopped me to see if we needed water. I have no idea what the water zombie wanted, or how badly he wanted to eat my brains, but we quickly left."," I got a spinach and goat cheese omelette that was surprisingly good.

"I'm going to go along with the other reviews since I only visited here once. It's good food, in a comfortable atmosphere. Great place for a date since its comfortable and has some more intimate seating up on the platformed area.As enjoyable as it was I had a weird confrontation with someone on shift the night I visited when I tried to use my Yelp discount/promotion. On another note, the waitress we had was brand new and trying extra hard to be helpful. Hopefully things worked out for her.They also would not let us try a wine we were offered after the bottle I wanted, and knew, was not available.

"Food was good. My service experience was not great but I think that it was rare- probably better usually. We came for Sunday brunch- outside full but inside empty. We were sat promptly and given tap water immediately by a male server. A female server asked us about drinks. Iced coffee yay! Then the male server asked us for drinks. No problem. We told him our coffees were coming but we'll order food. I ordered the chicken club. Server asked if I want the salad or the fries. I chose the salad. Table next to us gets seated and they are offered bottled water. Fine, we'd chose tap anyway. Table next to us' food is brought out. Our coffee is empty. (No refill offers the rest of the visit)Another table next to us (but outside) was sat 10 minutes after us. Their food comes out. We wait at least another 10 min before server says ""it'll be out in 2 seconds"". We wait 10 more minutes. Then we take matters in our hands and ask. ""Soon"" they say. It comes out. I get my sandwich with a big pile of fries. I told the server that although I love fries, I ordered a salad. He gets snippy with me and says something like ""oh, Um, well I only have 2 hands, I can't carry it all"". NO sir, do not get snippy with me. Bad excuse. It's salad OR fries, not both. It would be fine if it was a simple mistake. The excuse really turned me off. Bc it wasn't a good one. But I got both so it was remedied.., although we waited so long that my stomach almost ate itself! Food was great. Only complaint was that salad had nothing but greens and dressing. No cheese, veggies, nuts, whatever. Tasted fine but you know. But maybe that's bc they forgot I ordered it. Whatever! I'll give it one more chance."," Food was good.

"This place was awesome start to finish and the prices are an amazing value. For our table of 4, we had two bottles of wine, 2 apps, our own entrees, and 2 desserts and it cost us $50/person! That's what I call a DSD steal! Wow!The crostinis were interesting combinations: the pineapple, mascarpone and chili was the standout! Second runner up, taleggio, blackberry and pistachio. So good! The arancini was superb! It was one huge ball that was delicate and creamy on the inside topped with a flavorful tomato sauce. The entrees all were great. My cavatelli with clam sauce and spicy pancetta was really unique. Clams and pork? Say what? It made this distinct flavor where you had the essence of a typical clam sauce but had the salty fatty quality you get from pancetta. It was pretty stellar. My bites of the my friend's risotto and gnocchi were delicious too. No one went wrong with their choices. Then we get to dessert. And I'm not really a sweets person. I would normally want to have an extra appetizer vs dessert, but this place knocked dessert out of the park! Damn. The Nutella bread pudding was slamming. Oh my god that chocolate sauce! And the banana zepoles...hello, can you hear me, I'm in NY dreaming about you and me. Jesus these things were good. They were like balls of heaven. I can't wait to come back to Queens to come here again! Winner winner!"," This place was awesome start to finish and the prices are an amazing value My cavatelli with clam sauce and spicy pancetta was really unique.

"My first thoughts about Gastroteca was that they have a decent menu with extremely cheap cocktails and the ambience is out of this world.On second thought (after tasting their menu items) I am apt to still believe this, but I feel their food is lacking in flavor.My partner ordered a WINter75 cocktail and a fried eggplant and burrata sandwich and I ordered a bloody mary and had the crispy gnocchi.  Their WINter 75 cocktail was a winner.   Well balanced with the gin, prosecco, earl grey syrup (so delicate) and light on the lemon it was a definite hit.  I felt I was missing out on it once I tried it and wished I had ordered it instead.Their eggplant and burrata sandwich was okay.  The melty burrata seemed to give the sandwich some flavor but otherwise it was rather bland and felt like packing carbs.  It came with a side salad that was some lettuce leaves tossed in a very oiled down yet excellent balsamic.  It tasted good, but you could barely taste it.  Okay, the salad was pretty wimpy if we're being honest. My bloody mary was pretty horrid as far as the standard goes. It came without rimmer and the garnish was two clunkily sliced pieces of lemon and lime.  It looked like garbage, and it tasted merely alright.  The bloody mary mix they used was okay but they seemingly added nothing to it.My gnocchi was scantly plated.  They used a larger plate but there was barely any gnocchi on it.  The gnocchi itself was very fresh but with every bite I was searching for the flavor with it nowhere to be found.  I waited for the basil, pistachio and spinach to hit alas it never came. Would I come here again?  In a pinch, yes.  Will I be going out of my way? No, absolutely not."," Well balanced with the gin, prosecco, earl grey syrup (so delicate) and light on the lemon it was a definite hit.

"The decor, the menu selection, the layout of the place was a strong 5 in my book. Unfortunately for me the brunch food and drink fell a little flat. Ordered: Lamb & Spinach hash - the eggs were poached perfectly but I didn't get much from the pesto hollandaise in terms of flavor. The lamb was either shredded very finely or there wasn't much of it in the dish which was a bit disappointing. Bloody Mary special - thicker than your average BM mix, which I don't mind at all but the flavor is definitely on the smokier side. The bourbon infused bacon bits were interesting but I don't think I'd order againI really loved the space and there were other items that looked intriguing enough that I would def come back for a second try."," The decor, the menu selection, the layout of the place was a strong 5 in my book.

"What a gem in the heart of Astoria! After a Friday night of drinking, we were getting hungry and in the mood for some good ol' brunch food so some Yelp searches turned up Gastroteca, only a few blocks away and with high ratings. It was rather chilly, so we were given a seat indoors even though we loved the patio! So neat and cute with vibrant colors accenting the restaurant's black and white base colors.We each ordered a different brunch food off of the brunch menu: I personally got the California benedict (perfectly poached eggs with guacamole, roasted tomatoes and Hollandaise sauce on an English muffin, with delicious homefries). My friends got the Spaghetti Carbonara (this was SO good, and topped with smoked bacon, a fried egg and pecorino cheese - what more can you want in your pasta?) and the Sugar Dusted Texas Toast (stuffed with nutella! This was wonderful too).Overall, it was a wonderful dining experience, our waiter was very attentive and our waters were never empty. They were playing the Magic Schoolbus on the wall above the bar which was actually rather cute, and was very kid friendly too. During our meal, a child at another table actually fell off his high chair, and watching the staff help the boy (and his family!) feel better, even though it was no fault of Gastroteca's own, was charming to see. We'll be back again for your delicious food and wonderful service!"," What a gem in the heart of Astoria My friends got the Spaghetti Carbonara (this was SO good, and topped with smoked bacon, a fried egg and pecorino cheese - what more can you want in your pasta?)

"This was the worst brunch experience I have ever had for both the service and the food in Astoria. It was a total rip-off and I left so unsatisfied. I went to brunch with a couple of friends from out of town. I read fairly good reviews online about this place, so we gave it a try. What a big big big disappointment. I can't stop thinking about how bad of a brunch this was - i actually regret going there.The waiter was unwelcoming and cold. All Y/N responses.He was annoyed when I asked for a little adjustment in my meal (egg whites only - oh wait half an egg white and please charge me extra for it, too, and do not tell me about it). I had the most measly meal of all. I got the baked eggs terracotta - not worth the $13 at all. All it was was tomato sauce baked with a sprinkle of kale, beans, mushrooms and mozzarella. Oh yeah and an egg, which they charged me extra for an egg white and I had half of an egg white! What's wrong with you guys? it's brunch - where are the eggs? I paid $15 and was not full. It was like eating half a cup of tomato sauce and 2 slices of bread. Wow. I would be ashamed serving that as a brunch meal. The gnocchi - don't expect to get full because the serving was about maybe a little more than half a cup.  I should've spoke up to management before we paid the check, but I was embarrassed to say anything in front of my guests. What a shame of a place."," I read fairly good reviews online about this place, so we gave it a try. What a big big big disappointment.

"Very cute ambiance and friendly and professional service make Gastroteca a very solid Astoria brunch option right away.  Great range of brunch beverages, and I would say average menu items.  A recent visit puts Gastroteca at four stars for me - I had the spinach/goat cheese omelette, which, though very well plated, was very over-done resulting in a somewhat unappetizing texture/.flavor on the eggs.  The side salad and toast were good, albeit lacking any sort of punch.  Drinks were excellent.  My dining companions seemed to enjoy some of the other menu items - particularly one of the eggs benedict dishes, which looked very good.  Overall, it's well worth a visit.  It gets noisy and crowded, but all of the windows and tiered seating give it a spacious, airy, pleasant vibe."," enjoy Very cute ambiance and friendly and professional service make Gastroteca a very solid Astoria brunch option right away.

"We came in for brunch after reading all of the wonderful reviews.  The place has a rustic look that's very charming, the service was good and we were excited to try the food here.  We ordered the salmon crostini and the Italian  chicken and waffles. After eating a few bites of my salmon crostini and fries I started to wonder when the wonderful flavor would kick in.  What was really perplexing was the fact that the food looked so amazing however the taste was far from it. The   salmon and egg were very salty and the fries were just meh. I left most of the food on my plate.  I had a few bites of the chicken and waffles and the chicken was practically flavorless, it was as though they forgot to add any seasoning. The waffle was good. Perhaps the chef was just having an off day with the seasoning, the taste of the food left much to be desired."," The place has a rustic look that's very charming, the service was good and we were excited to try the food here.

"Came here on Sunday for brunch with another couple, and it was absolutely amazing. I don't typically ever go out for brunch, but we were running out of double date ideas so we tried this little place in Astoria, which was a halfway point for us. To start, we got three of their spicy bloody Mary's and my boyfriend got a Moscow Mule. Their bloody Mary's were pretty good. Not too spicy but definitely a kick. I thought they were a tad watery. Not sure if they batch them and let them sit in ice (something a lot of places do) because it tasted a bit too watery. My boyfriends moscow mule had mint in it, so he said it definitely tasted like a mojito rather than a mule, but it was fine cause he likes mojitos anyway so whatever! For food, we had meatball sliders, two orders of the chicken and waffles, the pesto chicken sandwich, and the lamb something. We literally ate EVERYTHING. It was soooo good. Esp the chicken and waffles!!!! I think they use real maple syrup too! I'm originally from the Adirondacks so that's what I'm used to and you would be surprised how many places done use the real stuff!! The service was great as well. Our waitress was super nice. Even when there was a mix up with out reservation, she was still super nice and accommodating. I wish I could remember her name. I felt bad because we were there for like 2 hours because we could just talk for ages, so we definitely ate up a table of hers for awhile, but she was so sweet about it! I live in Bay Ridge, so I don't know how often I will be back, especially because it was my first time in Astoria. However, if I ever find myself in Astoria, or if someone asks me for a recommendation, this will definitely be it!"," Their bloody Mary's were pretty good.

"I brought my family here for brunch on a Saturday. It was a full house, but we had reservations so the wait was not bad at all. Although the food was great, delicious and well prepared, we felt that the portions were a little bit on the small side for their price. The staff was really great - very attentive and did not rush us at all to leave once we were done.I would def be back because some of the items on the menu caught my attention...like nutella French Toast --- WHAAAATTT! I will def need to be on an empty stomach for that one.I was not completely sold on this place - mostly due to price and amount of food.

"This is my moms go-to spot for Mother's Day. I always make a early reservation for brunch as they book up very quickly. It was an almost 2 hour wait the day of to be seated.Normally the food is on point and I am never disappointed. However, my meal fell a little flat this time. I ordered the carbonara pasta which would have been delicious, but when I took my first bite, it wasn't even hot. I guess it had been sitting in the kitchen waiting for the other dishes to be completed. I also ordered the kale Caesar salad which was disappointing as well. It was just kale with lardons and very little dressing. I wasn't expecting anything spectacular but it was less than average and Gastroteca has never been average.Our started, however, were absolutely delightful! We always order the Texas toast which is stuffed with Nutella and coated in corn flakes (YUM!). We also chose the banana ricotta donuts which were like fluffy pillows of deliciousness in your mouth. They didn't have a lot of banana flavor which is a plus for me and they were so perfectly fried.

I came here with two girlfriend to enjoying the day off.. What better more then to have some brunch.. This place is beautiful very rustic I'd say. Waitress  extremely helpful since one my friends has Celiac Dieases. Everything we ordered was delicious..  I enjoyed a smoke salmon with fried capers and sautéed onions. I put a poached egg over it with flavorful hollandaise sauce. My friend had the fried chicken with buttermilk waffles and the other had  a shrimp scampi with grits I tried them both and very good choice.. Everything was so good..

"Omg this is like a hidden gem. This visit is based on one visit to brunch.As an appetizer I had the Stromboli which was just out of this world. It was super tasty.Next, I had the baked lasagna. This platter was super cheesy and delicious. The other person I had a shrimp scampi which was also very good. As a dessert, I had the Zeppoli's and honestly they weren't all that.I was super excited because all of the reviews mention it but it honestly isn't worth it. The only reason I am giving it four stars is because of the service.The service was not the greatest.Also they need more drink variations.More of the brunch drinks are bloody Mary's which I am not a fan of."," This platter was super cheesy and delicious.

"this place is ok, is does have a great location and decor, but the menu is tiny. I went for brunch very early Sunday right after I went to the gym, wasn't looking to drink really. Was happy they have nice juice choices but for $3.00 they serve it in a rocks glass, so basically you dont with it within 10 minutes. I had the salmon crostino, which wasn't bad. It was fresh and filling. I was asked several times throughout my short stay if I wanted anything to drink, aka pushing for those liquor costs, which became annoying after awhile. I would return if in the area, would try dinner next time."," this place is ok, is does have a great location and decor, but the menu is tiny.

"This restaurant has a modern decor with outdoor seating that I like. I came here to try their brunch on a Friday morning at 11:30. I had the opportunity to try their Rigatoni Carbonara  pasta dish. Gastroteca makes their pasta in house & it came out quite delicious and flavorful. The only thing was - I felt the pasta needed to be cooked a tad bit longer, just a tad. Other than that it was really good.I also had couple bites of the California Benedict. The eggs were perfectly poached & the yolk was snapchat worthy: runny. One of the eggs benedict, however, had a bit too much minced garlic but the other half was fine. The dish also came with home fries, which were seasoned so well and deliciously. Perfect.

"Great brunch spot! The food is consistently good weekend after weekend, the staff relaxed and welcoming (although every once in a whiley group will get an inattentive waitress, but usually stay for 3+ hours so it makes no difference), and the carafes typically strong. They are on Open Table and take rezzies for brunch which is a plus. Try the zeppoles and if you order the eggplant sandwhich definitely order extra sauce!"," Great brunch spot The food is consistently good weekend after weekend, the staff relaxed and welcoming (although every once in a whiley group will get an inattentive waitress, but usually stay for 3+ hours so it makes no difference), and the carafes typically strong.

Came here for brunch and had their belgian waffles and smoked atlantic salmon crostino. Both were decent dishes but nothing on these dishes made this place stand out. The waffle itself was kind of dry but all the toppings on it and syrup was much needed to help offset it. All the ingredients used were standard. It really felt like something I could have made at home if I had the ingredients.  My same thoughts are echoed to the salmon dish.Service was excellent. The place feels very spacious because of ceiling to floor windows.I'm sure the food is consistent but it's not a place that I will remember when looking for a brunch place given the many choices in the neighborhood., Came here for brunch Came here for brunch and had their belgian waffles and smoked atlantic salmon crostino All the ingredients used were standard.

"Came for brunch once it brunch was almost done but I decided that based on that menu I had to come back. And I did. So happy I did. I was seated at the high table and initially I was annoyed but hey, it was packed. After two mimosas I was loving the high tables. I went ahead and ordered the breakfast lasagna. And it was everything I needed to compliment my drink. It was hearty, and moist, cheesy and fresh. My only complaint was the size. But maybe it was just too darn good. Either way, my companion had the brunch Caesar salad and that too was delicious. Prices were standard, and waitress was friendly. Would come back"," Prices were standard, and waitress was friendly.

"This place has been bookmarked for me since I moved to Astoria about a year ago! I finally go to go this morning and I'm so happy to finally cross this one off. A friend and I went here around noon (on Sunday) so right smack dab in the middle of brunch time. I thought we'd have a hard time getting a seat, but we were able to get seated right away at the bar. This may have had to do with the fact it was raining, but they do take reservations too if you want to be sure you won't wait! My friend and I both ordered iced coffees which were refreshing but, you know, iced coffee. For brunch I got the California Benedict with homefries and oh by I was in heaven! Super flavorful and the perfect portion so you can leaving feeling full but not sick. Everything tasted super fresh and was hot when we got it. My friend got the salmon crostini which she also loved.

I thought we'd have a hard time getting a seat, but we were able to get seated right away at the bar.

"The atmosphere caught my attention so my girlfriend and I popped in for some quick drinks and dinner. Save yourself the disappointment and don't bother eating anything. The bread at the table was nothing short of some cornbread wonder bread hybrid. Far from Italian anything. It was awful. Our meals came, simple pasta dishes (ravioli and seafood pasta)  that should have been hard to mess up. The ravioli was caked in butter, the cheese was cold and dry inside. The seafood pasta had two shrimp and the tiniest muscles I've ever seen. Both portions small and very disappointing. I don't mind paying 15-25 a plate for good Italian food even if the portions are on the small side. This place over charged for just sub par food. I'll most likely never eat here again. Its like a nice place to get a drink... So that's where the two stars come from."," The bread at the table was nothing short of some cornbread wonder bread hybrid.

"One of the best brunches in Astoria! I can't count how many times I've been here for brunch (usually with a group of 8-10)  and we usually reserve the ""elevated"" dining area for ourselves. The food is always really good! They have standard brunch options with sandwiches and some pasta dishes mixed in, everything is always tasty - especially the fries! The service isn't always the quickest or friendliest but they do their job. Really good bloody marys and mimosas to compliment your brunch!

"Um, seriously? I can only describe my experience at Locale as bizarre. Though the restaurant wasn't full, we still had to wait to be seated. Then after we were seated, we were asked separately by three different servers if we wanted tap or sparkling water before we ended up having our glasses filled by a server that happened to be walking by with a pitcher. I had to order my coffee twice before I got it, and when it arrived, the coffee cup had a bright pink lipstick stain on it. Seriously? Then, we waited more than 30 minutes for our entrées. It wasn't even until the restaurant started to clear out that we got our food. How long does it take to poach an egg?ALL of this would be semi-forgivable if the food was outstanding, but unfortunately I found Locale's food to be just OK. Not only did it look a little bland, it tasted a little bland. My friends and I ordered three different versions of Eggs Benedict. I ordered the plain EGGS BENEDICT yelp.com/biz_photos/SPYM for the Canadian bacon but unfortunately there was only a meager piece on each english muffin. Sad. My friend who had the POACHED EGGS WITH BUTTERMILK BISCUIT AND COUNTRY GRAVY yelp.com/biz_photos/SPYM was equally disappointed. When our plates arrived, the first thing she said was, ""There's no green!"" Indeed, the brunch entrées that don't include vegetables don't even come with a small salad on the side - not a very balanced meal. My friend who ordered the PORTOBELLO BENEDICT yelp.com/biz_photos/SPYM fared much better and she really enjoyed her entrée. We also shared a side of CHEDDAR POLENTA. yelp.com/biz_photos/SPYM It was pretty decent, but when I think polenta I think of Vesta's amazing polenta brunch entrée and suddenly Locale's just can't compare.If I thought that this was just an isolated or fluke experience, I would have given Locale 3 stars, but my friend said she experienced the same lack of service the last time she was at Locale.

"Came here for Saturday brunch with friends.

"After one or two changes of chefs, Locale is just not what it used to be.  Don't get me wrong, I still think they have some of the best food around, but for the complete package, they have fallen off quite a bit.  As is frequently the case, I think Locale got a little too popular for its own good.  Its not a hidden gem anymore, its a weekend hotspot.Here is a sample of my issues tonight:Strike 1: I had made a reservation for 8pm and was called 2 hours before to let me know that only the lounge area was available.  I mentioned my wife was pregnant, but it seemed to be the lounge area or bust, so I begrudgingly accepted.  I really don't like sitting in the lounge area (even though I have many times).  The tables are just so low it makes it difficult to eat (especially if you have a bun in the oven) and it is basically knee-height causing extra discomfort.Strike 2:  They really overpack the restaurant at peak times.  It was extremely hot and crowded.  Also, the restaurant is one big fire hazard when its packed.  Tables feel a bit on top of each other.  My recommendation would be to go to Locale for an early dinner or brunch, but for peak times, it is just too hectic.Strike 3:  Speed of food service.  This is somewhat related to Strike 2 (see above), as the kitchen apparently can't handle the amount of tables they seat during peak times.  Tonight, our food was extremely slow.  Our waitress told us the food was being ""plated"" at one point, but it didn't come out until over 10 minutes later.  I think in the service industry it is never wise to promise something, then underperform, its rather bothersome.  Also, it should come as no surprise to a restaurant that it is going to be bumping on a Friday night and the kitchen should either (1) be prepared for the crowd, (2) don't seat so many tables so you can handle the orders timely and efficiently, or (3) move to a larger location and hire the appropriate help.  Strike 4? The chef will not substitute any of the sides on specials.  I just don't like paying good money for a meal and not being able to swap out a simple thing such as the type of potato, when the other type is also on the menu.  I must add that the maitre de was conscious of the slow delivery of food and did right by us, but I still feel I would be doing a disservice to yelp by not talking about my experience.  This gracious maneuver likely retained me as a customer, and as mentioned, I do really like their food. Get it together Locale!  I really want to call you my favorite Astoria restaurant once again!"," I really do Its not a hidden gem anymore, its a weekend hotspot.Here is a sample of my issues tonight:Strike 1: I had made a reservation for 8pm and was called 2 hours before to let me know that only the lounge area was available.

"Not at all a 4 star place, not sure how they have such a good rating right now. I couldn't believe what a rip-off this place was.I went here for New Year's with a bunch of friends and seeing as how it was a pretty expensive pre-fixe menu we figured we'd be getting some good food and service. We got the FAT bill we were expecting but that was about it. The food was just plain awful. I have absolutely no cooking experience but I could have made food better than the food they served us.Everything was pre-made in bulk so that they wouldn't have to prepare anything later. We tried to order a dish without pork and they couldn't oblige seeing as how it had already been made and was just waiting to be served. I could have walked half a block down the street to McDonalds and ordered something without pork and it would have been made fresh to order. That's just pathetic. Not only was it already prepared and ready to just be dished out, but the food was just bad. This is the only place I've been to where the decided to serve some sort of beef bullion soup. You know why this is uncommon elsewhere? because it's disgusting. No one wants that for soup. Everyone in our party took maybe two bites and set it aside.The steak was just average and I finished it just for the sake of eating with everyone. The dessert was forgettable and unimpressive as well. At the end they wanted to rush us out of there. They kept hovering over us and trying to get us to go even when we stood up, had our coats on and just wanted to stop for an additional 10 seconds to get a group photo. Oh I'm sorry, did we not just pay 1,200 dollars for some of the worst food of our lives? I think we can sit for another minute alright? But no, they came by again and told us that there were more people waiting even though we had reservations. They cheapened the whole experience while not skimping on the bill one bit.Pushy service, ridiculous prices, absent minded waitress, and just GOD-AWFUL food. Not a single person in our group had anything positive to say about this place. Maybe this is a place that should just close on new year's eve instead of acting like they are a 5 star restaurant and charging outrageous prices.Two stars is a generous rating especially with all of the other places in Astoria that have awesome deals and good food on New Year's Eve. Perhaps Locale is better during regular hours on a normal day but after the way we were treated there, I'm not going to bother to find out."," I couldn't believe what a rip-off this place was.I went here for New Year's with a bunch of friends and seeing as how it was a pretty expensive pre-fixe menu we figured we'd be getting some good food and service.

"Great food, great atmosphere. I've been to Locale several times, but never filled out a review. I'm a big fan of their brunch!I will say one thing... the waitress did not know what ""grilled cheese"" was.... don't recommend bringing the kids...",
"Nice neighborhood restaurant. Food was generally good. We were having a family dinner and ordered 4 appetizers and 4 entrees which was served family style as per our request. Appetizers included calamari, braise meatballs, duck confit, and Entrées included organic chicken, lamb ragu Pappardella, short rib risotto, and skirt steak.The lamb ragu Paparedella was the least favorite dish. The pasta seemed dry.The skirt steak was the best. The cocktail list comprise mostly of vodka based drinks. I definitely recommend a try."," Food was generally good.

"Very mediocre.  For the prices they are charging I expected much better.  We started off with their specialty cocktails.  I found mine to be a mismatch of flavors which sounded good on paper but wasn't good in execution.  It was supposed to be a mix of mescal, muddled cucumber, ginger and jalapeño. All I could taste was the cucumber. We then had the crostini. They were relatively good. But one was literally a paltry shmear of goat cheese with a presumably jarred roasted red pepper on top. As for entrees my wife liked her crisp gnocchi. I had the Bronzino which violated my cardinal rule of ""don't order fish at a place that doesn't specialize in fish"".  Low and behold I got a piece of fish that managed to be wildly underdone in some spots while wildly overdone in others. Far more disturbing was the lack of salt and general low tide fishy smell that came from the dish.  Deserts were a high point of the meal but still not amazing. Many of the other reviews complain about service issues.  I found the service to be friendly and attentive yet suffering from timing issues. We made it clear that we intended to order a bottle of wine with dinner. However they didn't get us the wine list until we were basically done with our meal.  We were glad we didn't get a bottle of wine but from a business point of view they lost out on a good sale due to timing issues.Ultimately at the price point they are asking there are FAR better places to eat than this without spending more money.  If the entrees were priced in the 12-15 dollar range I would give them another star or two.", I found mine to be a mismatch of flavors which sounded good on paper but wasn't good in execution.

"Great modern Italian restaurant - the inside decor and seating is simple but sophisticated. I love the use of natural light from the floor-to-ceiling windows.

"This place is a gem on an unassuming street in Astoria. But, that's the great thing about Astoria, there are so many random little places that are just waiting to be found. The Locale staff is so friendly and warm, they're good with each other and good with the clientele as well. The brunch was good-- The waffles were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside, and there was the right amount of bananas and walnuts to top it off. My girlfriend's avocado and tomato benedict was delicious also-- I love how they have super vegetarian friendly, and many, versions of the benedict. There was a tad bit too much tabasco in my bloody mary, but that's not really a deal-breaker. For dinner, my friends and I just hung out for an hour nursing some Chardonnay, while waiting for my roommate to finish dying her hair. The one thing that irked me about this place was that they didn't put our bottle of white wine in an ice-bucket? Do they normally not put it on ice or was that because we looked brutish and like it didn't matter? The food, though, was good. I really appreciated how un-salty everything was, from the fried zucchini, to the portobello salad, to the artichoke ravioli..."," But, that's the great thing about Astoria, there are so many random little places that are just waiting to be found.

"I came here on Saturday for brunch with three friends.  I ordered the California eggs Benedict (with avocado and tomatoes), my one friend got waffles and the other two got something with eggs.  We all loved the food and the drinks (mango mimosa was amazing).  The Locale had lots of variety and it took us a while to decide so I'm definitely looking forward to coming back and trying something new.The atmosphere at Locale was probably the best thing about this place.  It was beautiful outside that day so I was bummed to be sitting inside, but the place was so wide open that I felt like we were sitting outside the whole time.  The decor is also really cute - there are couches in the corner that I sat in a couple of months ago for another brunch.The service was great - the man who greeted us at the door (I assume he was the owner) was really sweet and our waitress was also great, very attentive.  We ordered dessert at the end (vanilla creme brulee, banana caramel napoleon and gelato) and were all very satisfied.  We even got dessert wine on the house at the end!Overall, a great experience - I will definitely come back."," It was beautiful outside that day so I was bummed to be sitting inside, but the place was so wide open that I felt like we were sitting outside the whole time.

"After reading all the great reviews about this place, my friends and I decided to give it a try for one of my friends birthday. Let me start off by saying, the place looks cute. And I am a sucker for cute places. The staff seemed decent. It was our waitress' first day on the job, so we understood why she was a bit awkward.We ordered the Chardonnay and the Lolita for drinks. The Lolita was pretty good. Next we ordered the braise meatballs and the regular salad as our appetizers. The braised meatballs were pretty good and the salad was well, a salad. For our entrees we ordered the Paparedella, Short rib Rissoto, Organic Chicken and the Rigotoni, All of the pasta dishes were very heavy. The Paparedella was OK, the short rib rissoto was good at first, but after a while you get bored of the taste, the Rigotoni was quite hard and was not worth it and the organic chicken was so dry. It is pretty hard to mess up a simple chicken dish, but Locale sure did. For dessert we got the chocolate cake and it was good.Overall it is an OK restaurant. The prices are pretty good for a cute place, but the food is not worth it.

"Sidewalk seating, great! Sangria, yum! Brunch, 'eh'...Let me start by saying there is a woman who lives nearby who drags her dog on a skateboard back and forth in front of the restaurant while you're eating. If that's not entertainment, I don't know what is.The service was okay, a little distant but efficient. The drinks were good. The food though, I dunno. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and I feel like it was just kind of missing some energy. It could have been hotter and the English muffin didn't have much crispiness to it. Believe me, you'll see the words Cheddar Polenta on the sides and you will think, ""omg, I must have that."". But do not be misled, it is not good. I wish it were and wish I  could praise its deliciousness but it really was just a bowl of orange colored cornmeal with some cheese melted on top. So disappointed.Maybe I should have ordered something different, but with so many other brunch options nearby, I don't think I'll give them a second chance.  If you check in with the Yelp app, you get 10% off the bill!

"Living nearby, I've been to Locale many times for brunch. The brunch menu is a great combo of breakfast and lunch fare, and I have always found the service to be quick and friendly but never rushed. But of course, there is an exception to every rule, and I have recently found myself less inclined to visit Locale. Recently I went with my boyfriend and his mom, and it was a bit crowded. The hostess told us to take a seat at the bar for coffee and drinks and we would be seated at a table as soon as it was available - perfect! However, once we sat down and had our coffee poured, we were forgotten. Parties that came in after us were seated, even though we said we did not want to stay at the bar. When we approached the hostess, it was obvious that she had forgotten to re-seat us.And the last time I tried to brunch here, I made reservations for 2pm on Saturday, as my mom was visiting from out of town. At 11:30am THAT MORNING, I received a call that they needed to cancel my reservation. A large party had bought out the entire restaurant. Yes, they were apologetic, but come on - I find it hard to believe that they found out less than 3 hours ahead of time.So, hit or miss on service/reservations, but I always enjoy my meal! And relatively cheap to boot!"," enjoy The brunch menu is a great combo of breakfast and lunch fare, and I have always found the service to be quick and friendly but never rushed.

"I've lived in Astoria for 6 years now and this is by and far my favorite restaurant in the area.  Their pasta dishes and fish specials are always fantastic.  I don't eat meat aside from fish, but my wife had the roasted chicken dish the last time we were there and was floored with the quality.The wait staff has always been very friendly and the bar is fully stocked and the bar tenders know what they're doing.I saw some negative posts about the owner, which I can't speak to, but I will say that every interaction I've had with him has been very positive.  He has always come over to make sure we were enjoying our meal."," enjoy Their pasta dishes and fish specials are always fantastic.

"Came here on a Friday night w/ the BF. We were looking to stay local and have a nice dinner with out out having to drive or take the subway back into the city. After reading many reviews, I decided on Locale. Used my opentable account here, which is a huge plus because I like planning ahead and racking up points. The place itself it pretty small and easy to miss, we actually walked right by it. There are like 5-6 dinner tables inside, a full bar, a back lounge area with couches and some tables, and also outside seating.  We sat inside near the window. Very comfy.Had a few drinks, my Dirty Kettle One Martini was made perfectly..Thank you. For my Entree, I had the Black Linguini- with squid ink, sausages, calamari and other goodness. Absolutely delicious. I killed the entire plate. I would definitely come back here just for this carb overload. The BF had the pappardelle & lamb ragu...which he wasn't crazy about. I think it was the whipped goat cheese that came on top that made it taste kinda funky. They should put the whipped goat cheese off to the side, where you have the option of mixing it in. Just a suggestion.Of course I had a sweet tooth at the end of my amazing and very filling linguini dish, so we shared the Flourless Dark Chocolate Cake w/ Espresso Gelato on top. Drool. I have nothing more to say about that. Divine.Dinner here wasn't cheap, the prices are moderate..slightly  expensive...more expensive than most  places in the  neighborhood. I  will definitely be back and would like to try brunch. Perfect place for a date or with friends for a classy simple dinner without traveling out of Astoria."," I would definitely come back here just for this carb overload.

"My girlfriend and I went the first time for brunch which was nice so we came back yesterday for dinner and how disappointing!!we ordered 2 cocktails and some crostini before the appetizers ,the cocktails were very small (12$each) and we did not finish yet the crostini that they bring the appetizers on the very small table makes you feel uncomfortable and a little bit in a hurry.the portion were smaller than expected at the end it s too much expansive for the service and the cuisine provided",
"Again, a dinner that was shockingly good, and a great value!  Appetizer of softshell crab came with 2 of the delectable crustaceans and an all day happy hour is reason enough to stay for a full dinner. #bestculinaryreinvention2015",
"The new menu  is not as interesting as the old one. More importantly, the food was just plain lousy: mussels fra diavolo cold, and the lasagna Bolognese both burnt and needed a ton of salt. I've never been disappointed before here...but this meal stunk. Not sure I'm coming back.",
"Don't eat here. Just don't. My wife and I came in on a Friday night to a half-empty house. Initially the service was good. Our waiter, identified on the check as Robert, was fairly knowledgable about Italian food and wine. He made a solid wine recommendation for pairing with the food I ordered, and was fairly  attentive, although he seemed inordinately harried for a less-than-crowded restaurant. The food, when it arrived, was okay. The portion of fried calamari my wife and I shared was generous, but slightly underseasoned. In addition to the standard marinara sauce and lemon wedge, the plate was topped with a fried long green pepper, whose spiciness paired well with the lightly battered squid. The entrees, though, were less than impressive. My wife's gemelli aqua pazza with shrimp had way too few shrimp--I understand that shrimp is both singular and plural, but still--and had no fennel and little tomato broth, two key ingredients in an aqua pazza dish. I ordered the polenta bolognese with a fried egg. Unfortunately, the egg was the best part. The ragu bolognese was dry, and the polenta was incredibly underseasoned and lacking in richness. Polenta, even when made with water or broth, should be generously finished with butter and cheese for flavor, body and mouthfeel. This was just flat. Still, I understand that I'm eating in Astoria, and I can't expect too much from the restaurants here. So I  would have given Gastroteca at least one more star, had it not been for the miserably poor service we experienced after our entree plates had been cleared. Our waiter brought us dessert menus promptly, took our dessert and digestif order (chocolate cake and a glass of port), and then vanished. The rest of the floor staff in a by now empty restaurant were congregating by the bar, chatting with each other, ignoring us completely. Eventually, the manager wandered over to let us know that our dessert would be coming out soon. It didn't. When it finally arrived, the vanilla ice cream that was supposed to be on the plate had been accidentally replaced by apricot sorbet. By the time we were able to flag down a server to get the mistake corrected, the sorbet was half melted. Instead of removing and replacing the dessert, they just dropped off a side dish of the correct ice cream without an apology. Again, it took forever to get the check, and I was surprised to find the botched dessert on my bill. I asked to speak to the manager, and when I pointed out the problem, he interrupted me with, ""Okay okay okay! I'll take care of it!"" He took the dessert off the bill without an apology, I paid the bill, and my wife and I left. My wife and I have a combined two decades of experience in the restaurant industry, her in the front of house, and me as a cook and chef. So we're both pretty generous when it comes to mistakes in restaurants. But the general ineptitude of the service and inability to make up for it on a slow night is absolutely inexcusable. If you can't be good at your job, you should at least be kind. Gastroteca's service was neither. Don't eat here. Just don't."," Initially the service was good.

"Went for Queens Restaurant Week menu. The service and ambiance were lovely and the reviews from Yelp so positive that the meal itself was a let-down for me. The zucchini fries appetizer was enjoyable, I enjoyed the unique presentation of the vegetable. The main dish, however, a lemon chicken, left much to be desired. The chicken was dry, not lemony, and had very little sauce to accompany it. The highlight of the meal was the dessert - both the lemon pana cotta and chocolate mousse were flavorful and delicious. I may come back to try the pastas off their regular menu and some more dessert but with all the great restaurants to visit in Astoria it won't be anytime soon."," enjoy Went for Queens Restaurant Week menu The zucchini fries appetizer was enjoyable, I enjoyed the unique presentation of the vegetable.

Little Pricy for the portions but service was great! Limited selection on the menu. Would of liked to see a little more variation for brunch. Waffles were a bit on the tough chewy side.

"Had a dinner here once that was really great but subsequent brunch and dinners have been mediocre.

No roe to be found and very spicy even for someone who enjoys spicy food (was not mentioned in the description).", enjoy Had a dinner here once that was really great but subsequent brunch and dinners have been mediocre.

"This place is absolutely stunning. I always passed by it but it looked like any other cafe. Little did I know, Locale knocked my socks off. My boyfriend had the calamari and pasta and I had the polenta with chicken. His pasta was delicious and everything was HOT (temperature) which was a great! My chicken was a little salty and it could've used another component but overall I did enjoy it. Okay, so lets talk about the drinks now. My boyfriend had a coffee, very good nothing spectacular. On the other hand, I indulged a delicious Antioxitini, BEST DRINK EVERRR!!!"," enjoy His pasta was delicious and everything was HOT (temperature) which was a great!

"I don't frequent Locale as often as I'd like. In fact, the last time I went there this last weekend it was so epic, I had to write this review. First off...it was during the hour they were crossing over to dinner food. (for which they close the kitchen for one hour)....so, we got there just in time to have breakfast and lunch on the brunch menu. We were preparing for Hurricane Irene and perhaps our last meal(s) out.  We were gonna try to wait it out to eat dinner but that just got to be too much;)I don't remember what I ordered, it must have been penne la vodka which was very good. But, everything is hazy before  trying my friends Belguim waffles with almond whip cream. (heavenly music and rays of light beaming through the parting clouds). It was A-MAZING! I finally found my fav brunch spot in Astoria. I usually like eating salty foods for brunch. However, I will say that even in the midst of trying to stick to a low-carb diet, this is one sinful pleasure I cannot pass by. I will be back for you!"," I don't frequent Locale as often as I'd like. In fact, the last time I went there this last weekend it was so epic, I had to write this review.

"It has been several days since the usual horror that is parking in Astoria guided me into Locale. I must say for once in my life I can thank the nightmarishly scarce parking condition for helping me find this Astoria gem.If you were to only try one thing at Locale it would have to be the Crispy Zucchini. Days later the heavenly taste of these lightly fried wonders still linger on my taste buds. I enjoyed one of the evening specials, Chicken Rolatini, while my friend savored the Pappardelle & Lamb Ragu. After one bite of her entree I was trying to think of ways to overtake her meal and have it as my own.With a tastefully appointed interior, a well stocked bar and some outdoor seating Locale provides a great spot for a workday lunch, Sunday brunch or an intimate date night."," enjoy I must say for once in my life I can thank the nightmarishly scarce parking condition for helping me find this Astoria gem.If you were to only try one thing at Locale it would have to be the Crispy Zucchini.

"I wish I had discovered this place sooner! I stopped here the other night with a friend and enjoyed the nice weather in their outdoor seating. The food was phenomenal! I highly recommend the lamb ragu. Just thinking about the fresh pasta, lamb ragu, and cheese makes my mouth water. The crispy zucchini is addictive. I could probably live on the crispy zucchini for months. The food is fresh and hormone free. Not to sound cliché, but I could taste the freshness with every bite.The interior is beautifully decorated. It's modern with a rustic twist. Service was friendly and attentive.

"**OVERALL**  Ambiance is casual and quiet most nights.  Food has always been hot, flavorful, and creative enough to warrant the price.  Specials are worth trying.  Clean, simple, inviting.  Brunch is great too.--THE STORY--  I have been here and back a couple of times.  Some for brunch, 1 lunch, and the rest dinners.  I have never had a bad experience and I have had different servers each time.  Never felt that I had to flag down anyone since out table was visited numerous times and sometimes by more than just our server.  Very attentive in my opinion.  The food has been moderate to great.  It was always just as advertised and the last visit, we ordered apps, entree, and desserts off the specials menu.  Some of the best bistro style food I've had in Astoria.  You will probably have to ask for descriptions of the drinks at brunch since they just have a name, but so far, all the drinks we tried were better then good.    Atmosphere was calm, relatively quiet, and simple.  Nothing flashy.    Prices were normal for a nice night out, but not steak house prices.  Drinks were about the same and most local restaurants.    Don't forget to check-in using your phone's Yelp app to get a discount on your bill.  Always a nice perk."," **OVERALL**  Ambiance is casual and quiet most nights.

"I went to Locale recently. I like the place, service was very good, our waitress was helpful. But i didn't like the food...I ordered crabcake as a appetizer, nothing outstanding and also it was very spicy for me.

It was quiet for a Saturday night, we sat at the bar and had a delicious peppermint hot chocolate, papardelle lamb ragu and pistachio-crusted fried cod.

For drinks, we ordered a bottle of Nero D'Avola (mi favorito!) and it did not disappoint.  For our main courses,  I ordered the special: grilled swordfish with asparagus on a thin bed of mashed potatoes. It was very tasty and the portion was just right. My friend ordered the pasta bolognese and really liked it. Finally, we decided to indulge in a dessert so we shared a chocolate bread pudding, topped with glazed bananas and served with vanilla ice cream.AMAZING.

"This is my third review of Locale and comes after working with the owner of this Astoria hotspot, Johnny, to throw a surprise engagement party for two of my best friends.  With  that said (and after eating here 15+ times), I highly recommend it for a special occasion.  First, it took about a week to finally talk to the right person (the owner).  This included multiple calls and physically going to the restaurant twice.  The deal was 18 people, it needed to be a surprise, and we had a budget of $15 per person (this included food, gratuity, but no drinks).  Originally I figured I would order an assortment of appetizers to stay within budget and have them brought out in increments.  Johnny offered to do menu items that weren't on the menu and were also much more fitting to the occasion (and within my budget).  Locale allowed us to reserve the entire back area (space for 20, comfortable benches, small tables, and set higher than the main seating area).  They also assigned us our own server who took everyone's individual drink orders.  He was great.  Helpful, quick, professional, not in our business too much.  One time he did bring me a second of a drink without me ordering it.  I'm not a fan of this move (I'm sure it's great in some circumstances).  The food was great and impressed everyone (most importantly the bride and groom).  Beef sliders (aged angus), stuffed mushrooms (vegetarian) and bruschetta.  The sliders stole the show and were perfect two-bite (for some, three) morsels of beef, cheese, brioche and teeny crunchy pickle.  The atmosphere was perfect.  The service was also top-notch.  The drinks, as always, top notch.  I used to think poorly of that fact that they don't have a tap, but with the chancing selection of specialty bottled beers, I'm a happy man.  Blue Moon is $5 or you can spring for a *perfect* $10 passion martini. Again, five stars to Locale.  I highly recommend this Astoria hotspot in general, but also for a special occasion."," I highly recommend it Originally I figured I would order an assortment of appetizers to stay within budget and have them brought out in increments.

"Very nice place for dinner. We had a lovely evening last night at Locale. The ambiance is great, and the friendly staff really adds to a relaxed atmosphere. We had the mussels, which were fresh and delicious, and the pasta Amitriciana. The pasta was perfectly prepared in a smoky, spicy sauce. For mains we ordered the crispy branzino and the Tuscan sirloin. The branzino dish was flavorful and cooked to perfection. The sirloin however was a little tough, and under seasoned. The specially cocktails are a nice touch, but both were incredibly sweet. Overall, we had a great time, and a nice meal."," Very nice place for dinner.

"The food was Fantastic, tasty, and all around worth every cent! Only reason this place gets a 4 from me is the time it took to be seated. We were showed where our table is and that it needed to be cleaned. Still took about several minutes to be seated after it was cleaned. That's minor, but a bit annoying. Then our food took a while to come and that added to my annoyance. Everything was great after the food arrived. I would definitely go back for brunch, but perhaps on a weekday instead of weekend."," The food was Fantastic, tasty, and all around worth every cent!

"After walking by Locale dozens of times, I stopped in for a late dinner. I think it's more of a brunch spot. The decor is lovely. It's modern, but elegant. The service was also very good. The waitress was friendly and checked in on us a few times, but without being annoying or overbearing. However, there was 90s music blaring the entire time. it distracted from the ambiance. The food wasn't really good. We started out with a cheese plate. I though the selections were odd. There was a spicy and rock hard asiago, a truffle fontina, and a some type of blue. They didn't match up with one another very well  and the bread they served with it was slightly burnt. I ordered the chicken with roasted veggies and we also had the artichoke ravioli, which was drowning in a bland cream sauce. The chicken was a little dry, but it was edible. It came with a carrot puree that was good.The menu could have been a bit more innovative. Maybe had more seasonal choices. Not sure if the brunch menu is better, but I don't think I'd go back for dinner."," I though the selections were odd.

"Finding organic, delicious, and truly fulfilling restaurants in Astoria is hard. But, finding Locale has been a truly REFRESHING experience for me and my partner. To start, the service here is friendly, attentive, and focused on the menu. The feeling of this place is relaxed and extremely enjoyable. I recommend starting with the mussels and meatballs as an APP. The sauce and quality of the mussels are truly delicious, as is all of the food. Our Entree favorites are typically found in the 'specials' which the wait staff will happily and naturally describe to you during your stay. On the regular menu, try the short ribs or salmon...yummy!! Lastly, for drinks during your meal DEFINITELY try the Writers Block or The Cider... Seriously amazing!! A GREAT place in Astoria...

"Came here for brunch with a friend.  I had a variation of eggs ben.  Can't really go wrong there.  I did request that the hollandaise be on the side, but somehow the request was lost in the kitchen.  Our server apologized, she was quite pleasant.  The ambiance is nice, good for conversation, not too loud or busy as you may expect of a popular brunch place.  Decor is attractive.  Overall, pretty solid.  I would definitely revisit, but after trying some of the other places in the area.  I've also heard Locale serves delicious meals at other times of day."," Came here for brunch Came here for brunch with a friend Our server apologized, she was quite pleasant.

Can't go wrong with brunch here....my favorite special the huevos rancheros became a part of the menu recently and I couldn't be happier...the Freddy Kruger Bloody Mary is to die for...this place is good for dinner too and a great setting for both romantic and friendly dates....service is great and food is delicious the only downside is being stuck with one of the tables by the door during the winter time and dealing with the cold,

"We went for brunch, and were blown away by their menu. Every item sounded appetizing, from cheese polenta to the poached eggs with avocado and tomato. I decided on the eggs Benedict with portobello and arugula. It was delicious, but the hollandaise was a bit sharp. The rosemary potatoes were to die for and the coffee was solid. Hubby had the hanger steak with fries, cooked to perfection. Portions were average and we were too full for dessert. The dark wood tables, and the couches facing vintage brocade wall paper along the back wall looked chic. This place has a hipster vibe and service is breezy and cool, to be expected.

"Great vibe to Locale. Very quaint and intimate. My boyfriend and I sat outside to enjoy the gorgeous weather, and I must say that the serivce is outstanding. Great music playing, impressive menu, and to think that you can resist passing up the delicious desserts here is a joke! I had such a phenomenal experience at Locale I could not just keep it to myself.

"We absolutely LOVE locale - It's one of our favorite restaurant in Astoria. Perfect for Brunch and Dinner.  The wait staff is very attentive, the decor is stunning, and the food is fabulous. Although we have not tried everything yet, our favorite dishes are: 1)  The Fagotini beet pasta - I'm a huge pasta fan, and this dish was so unique and delicious 2) Veal Scallopini - perfectly done with tasty greens on the side. 3) The artichoke truffle Ravioli - Again, so unique and such a creative and perfect mix of flavors. The ingredients are always fresh, and the atmosphere is perfect for a date or a night out with some friends."," Perfect for Brunch and Dinner The wait staff is very attentive, the decor is stunning, and the food is fabulous.

"I was looking for an organic restaurant to go with my boyfriend on Friday night and Locale exceeded my expectations! I was very impressed with the service and the food was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I had the ""Tropical Salad"" and the cod special, I cannot stop talking about how delicious and healthy both dishes were. My boyfriend ate every last bite of the hanger steak special and wanted more. The antioxitini drink is refreshing and perfect for a hot summer night. Not only was the food great, but the atmosphere was beautiful and very now! The restaurant is not very big which I love. It is warm and welcoming with a rustic chic decor. The owner stopped by our table to ask how everything was. We got to talking and he was so kind and down to earth he ended up treating us to a drink at the bar. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOCALE and I cannot wait to go back!"," I was very impressed with the service and the food was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING I had the ""Tropical Salad"" and the cod special, I cannot stop talking about how delicious and healthy both dishes were.

"Came down here on a nice mid-week evening during restaurant week w/my eatin' buddy. I parked myself and my journal at the bar earlier than our reservation. Even tho the place was kinda quiet for 7p, there were a few tables and a couple other seats at the bar taken. Once my buddy arrived, we moved ourselves and our beers to the table.I did the restaurant week menu special and he did the regular menu. We both had steak. Mine was way yummier. As were my sides. And my dessert. We sampled each others and both agreed mine was the winner, although his was also very good. Fries were WAY salty though(for both of us.) Hope those restaurant week items are now regularly on the menu. Servers were nice and smiley and bus boy service was sharp.After we stuffed our faces, we returned to the bar for a round of drinks. Their signature cocktail the ""Lolita"" was mighty tasty. My bud had some dirty martinis (if I recall) and he had no complaints. Bartender was super sweet."," I parked myself and my journal at the bar earlier than our reservation And my dessert Servers were nice and smiley and bus boy service was sharp.After we stuffed our faces, we returned to the bar for a round of drinks.

"I took my girlfriend to this restaurant because I drive by it everyday I'm at work. It looks quaint and I was right. The decor and ambience was welcoming with various types of seating depending on how you want to dine- bar, couches, tables, and bench seating. My girlfriend's passion fruit martini was tasty and strong. I ordered the locale burger which was ginormous! And my girlfriend chose the hanger steak over the duck. I loved my burger and she liked the steak though it was charred outside and rare but still good. Service was friendly.", My girlfriend's passion fruit martini was tasty and strong.
"It was the first real Spring night of the season and my boyfriend and I decided we wanted to eat outside. We'd been to Locale for a drink before and figured, why not try it out again!We were glad we did. I got the Skirt Steak Special which was served over oven roasted potatoes and spinach which a very good reduction over it. My boyfriend had the Pepperdelle and Lamb Ragu which was equally as tasty. He didn't have any leftovers for lunch the next day :) We paired our entrees with a Montepulciano and it was a great fit!

Three words: Portobello eggs Benedict!I'm always happy when a Brunch place has a good eggs Benedict. Here at locale, the Portobello eggs Benedict was money! I wish the Portobello mushrooms were a bit bigger though, at least big enough to fill the english muffin, but I gotta say, still enjoyed it.

"First of all i would like to say that this place is awesome! Huge Fan. Whenever i come here i stay for HOURS (8hrs once). I come for lunch, drinks then dinner. If it gets too chilly outside you can move right into their lounge. The gnocchi is supberb! I actually came here last night with my cousin and he ordered the Organic Lemon chicken which i tasted and i had the Mahi Mahi which was a little over cooked but i still ate the whole thing. Their cheese plates are yummy. Their grilled calamari is delicious, we always have 2 orders of it. For brunch:The nutella french toast with a Freddy Krueger blood mary  with those delicious stuffed olives they serve with it :)seriously if anyone wants to go here and doesnt have a date, let me know. id love to dine here ANYTIME!its a shame that their staff has a huge turnover rate though :("," First of all i would like to say that this place is awesome!

"The owner here is bad. Not only are his people skills ridiculous and he seems to enjoy treating this restaurant as a personal buffet for his family more than a 4 star. I saw him manhandle his waitress to make sure his son had plenty of organic juice, while the waitress was clearly swamped and in the weeds, we had been waiting 50 minutes for our order of fish, and this guy's kid gets three servings of juice as soon as his glass is empty. (Meanwhile, the guy eating at the bar's had an empty glass as long as I could stare at it!) Then after I had one complaint he had to get involved, and the man actually came over to argue with me. Told me if I didn't want mushrooms with my order that I should've ordered it that way - which I didn't! Then he switched gears and told me I should've ordered something without mushrooms if I hate them so much.  (Fine point! But coming from a restaurant background I know that's the worst way to handle a customer.)Now I've been going to the locale for a couple years, and service was fine way back when, but even since the new lady's taken over the bar staff's been making more mistakes/arguing with each other/underpouring customers. (noticed that two visits ago.) That's not a big deal since table service is still alright - especially during brunch - but if you want good Italian especially during peak hours, I'd suggest going a little deeper into queens. Even woodhaven has a couple very nicer, more private spots for the same price with better service."," enjoy I saw him manhandle his waitress to make sure his son had plenty of organic juice, while the waitress was clearly swamped and in the weeds, we had been waiting 50 minutes for our order of fish, and this guy's kid gets three servings of juice as soon as his glass is empty.

"Yes,  I am definitely a fan of Locale. I recently discovered this place and when there for brunch with some friends. The decor is hip and unique and it seems to draw in a sophisticated crowd, even for brunch on Sunday when most are hungover. The service was good- the waiter was very friendly and attentive. The food was DELISH- we ordered the nutella french toast for the table and it was devoured in seconds.

"My sister and I took my mom here for a Saturday birthday brunch. Made a 2pm reservation via Open Table before the restaurant opened - but we weren't seated until almost 2:30pm because ""other customers were lingering."" I get not wanting to kick people out, but then block off a table an hour early when you have a reservation. (You don't ask an 80-year-old woman to have a drink at the bar.) The food however was amazing and once we were seated at our table we had a lovely time. I had the Belgian waffle with bananas and walnuts and a side of applewood-smoked bacon, my sister had the classic eggs Benedict, and my mom had the eggplant and burrata sandwich with fries. We all loved our food and shared. We got coffee and one chocolate gelato and one vanilla creme brulee for dessert to share. These were great though the creme brulee was a little too luke warm and runny. My sister had pinot grigio and I had 2 bloody marys which were delicious - just the right amount of spice and alcohol. Their brunch menu is all a la carte however and does not include sides or drinks. the decor is cute and I like how they project movies on the wall behind the bar. It is also not so loud that you can't hear the conversation at your own table - I hate that but here we had no problem at all. It was a lovely time and all was delicious and I will go there again - just not until I have a whole afternoon or evening to blow because the service is so slow as well as the wait, even with a reservation."," The food however was amazing and once we were seated at our table we had a lovely time I had the Belgian waffle with bananas and walnuts and a side of applewood-smoked bacon, my sister had the classic eggs Benedict, and my mom had the eggplant and burrata sandwich with fries. the decor is cute and I like how they project movies on the wall behind the bar.

"Was going through my checked-in places on yelp.. and saw Locale. For the life of me, I could NOT remember what place this was! And I was just there 5 days ago!Then it finally hit me. Sunday brunch!! I think that says a lot about this place..Now for the actual review..Service is REALLY REALLY REALLY slow. I believe we waited about an hour for the food to come out. Now the food is pretty good. But it shouldn't have taken that long to prepare! I had the southern omelet. The eggs were so light and fluffy. I love that. The bf had the burger.. very juicy. Another ordered the gnocchi and the 4th ordered the portebello benedict. All were very good. After eating, we forgot how bad the service was because our food was so good so we decided to have dessert there. Another 20-30min passed before our desserts finally came. Bf and I shared the tiramisu. YUMMY!! The other couple shared the warm apple cobbler. That was disappointing.This place is definitely a one time try.. and I'm glad I got to try it once. But never again."," For the life of me, I could NOT remember what place this was! Sunday brunch Now the food is pretty good. But it shouldn't have taken that long to prepare!

"On my way to see Cowboys And Aliens, so I decided to stop by Locale for a meal. The hostess asked if I wanted to sit inside or out, and given the sour smell of the interior [not always the case] I opted for the outside. I wasn't given the specials, just a menu shoved on my table. I know there were specials, because another waiter recited them to a couple sitting in his station after I had already ordered. The waitress did the same to a group sitting next to me. So 25 minutes later I get the hen, which was forgettable, plain, bland. I've had more excitement proctoring the State Regents Exam. The meal was a solid ""C"". Although I really just wanted to get the experience over with, I ordered the creme brulee as a last ditch effort to like this place. It was like getting a scoop of your favorite ice creme to make up for a day at the amusement park being rained out."," The waitress did the same to a group sitting next to me.

"After a good friend's reco, we came here for brunch, and we really got what we expected, because my friend knows what she's talking about.  The menu is incredible, I had the hardest time choosing what i wanted and finally decided on the cheddar polenta, which for an eastern-european girl like me, was heaven.  my husband had the omelet, which didn't disappoint, and the freddy krugers are just extra spicy bloody mary's, right up our alley.  Can't wait to go back, and dying to try the dinner menu, the only shortcoming was the service."," The menu is incredible, I had the hardest time choosing what i wanted and finally decided on the cheddar polenta, which for an eastern-european girl like me, was heaven. my husband had the omelet, which didn't disappoint, and the freddy krugers are just extra spicy bloody mary's, right up our alley."

Quick and amicable as well as helpful when you had questions on the menu or specials. We both split the mussels as an appetizer and they were HUGE! We've had mussels at other restaurant in the neighborhood and these were by far the best.While the menu looked amazing, we both decided to order from the nightly specials. My date has the long island duck that was served with chorizo sausage pieces, white sweet potatoes and a plumb sauce. The presentation was amazing and all the tastes ran together so nice. I would usually not opt for duck when eating out, but after tasting some of hers, i would absolutely come back and order this.I went with the short ribs special. This was incredible. Anytime short ribs is on a menu or a special, 9 times out of 10 its going to be great. But this dish was so different and exploding with taste. It was short ribs, served over cheddar cheese polenta in a mush room reduction, topped with fried onions. so freakin good.Over all, the dishes were amazing and the service was super friendly.

"Wonderful service, delicious food, lovely ambience. Went with the girl for our six month anniversary.The portabello and goat cheese crustini salad was beautiful and tasty; just enough to start us off. The Goat Cheese was just perfectly toasted, and was my favorite part of the meal. We shared the Black Linguini with Calamari and Sausage for our main. Also well presented and succulent. A little on the buttery side, which I am always cool with. Calamari was just fine. (The girl ate the sausage, so I can't comment on that.) (You liked that double entendre, did you?)The service was excellent. From the moment we entered the premises (barely even through the doors) we were greeted and invited to choose whatever table we'd like. Our servers and runners were just lovely - interested in making small talk to show their personalities and understanding when it was appropriate to leave us to our meal. Dishes, food, and all were handled and set quickly and gracefully. The owner of the restaurant even came around after we'd finished up to ask how we'd enjoyed his place. He gave us each a bit of moscato as thanks for our feedback.

"Have you ever walked by one of those restaurants that look trendy and have a ton of people hanging out outside. A place to be seen, all about the scene. That's the vibe you get when you stroll by this restaurant. I've walked by this joint a few times since moving back to Astoria. This last weekend I finally tried it out.Walked up and was greeted straight away and sat promptly. Menus dispersed and specials described. We were left to browse the menu and take in the surroundings. As a restaurant goes it does have a great feel to it. The atmosphere here is one that is relaxed and pretty hip with out trying to be. But I guess that's where the good ended. The brunch menu was small, and the food was OK. Not bad by any means just not something that would blow your mind away. The part of the puzzle that let me down the most, that prevented getting that extra star I would have to say is the service. Slow and inattentive is what we got. Not even a check up to see how we were doing. No ketchup, and no condiments brought to the table. Just wish the service was better. So if you find yourself with in walking distance of this place go ahead and give it a shot.

"As a huge fan of brunch living 2 blocks away from Locale, I was excited to have a highly rated brunch place so close to me.  When I got the chance to try it last summer, I was really surprised that it was so subpar.   The restaurant was empty and service was attentive, but I cannot really get around the strangeness of the food.  I got the portobello mushroom benedict, which was fine but nothing memorable.  My friend got the spinach and goat cheese omelet, and this was very strange.  The texture was very smooth and kind of spongey.. it didn't seem like real eggs.  And it was cold.  Spinach and goat cheese omelet is pretty hard to mess up but we were both taken back by how  un-omelet like it was.   I've had many omelets,  I don't expect them to be amazing all the time.  It is, after all, just an omelet - something you can make at home easily.   In this case, we both wished we had just gone to my apartment and made our own omelets.   Or several avenues over to DiWine.  My friend also got a side of polish sausage, which was alright - reminded me of a hot dog.  I enjoy a hot dog now and then (okay, only at baseball games, really) but it wasn't what I was expecting.  I do like the feel of the place.  It seems chic and popular in the evening, and it was nice to sit outside. To summarize:  Strangely textured omelet, odd tasting water, an okay portobello mushroom benedict, somewhat sweet mango mojito, and hotdog-like sausage amounts to a mediocre brunch in terms of food.  However, the pleasant fall Sunday weather and outdoor dining experience made it a charming brunch experience."," enjoy When I got the chance to try it last summer, I was really surprised that it was so subpar.

The texture was very smooth and kind of spongey.. it didn't seem like real eggs. It is, after all, just an omelet - something you can make at home easily. Or several avenues over to DiWine I do like the feel of the place"
"The boy brought me here after I suggested something upscale but not stuffy for a Monday night outing.  I'm a foodie - both cooking and eating - so I appreciate a place that has a thoughtfully planned menu as well as knowledgeable staff. We shared a bunch of stuff: a perfectly medium cooked skirt steak with ""fries"" (really, just slices of baked potato) and baby arugula salad, blue crab stuffed ravioli (seriously, it was insane) as well as a flour less chocolate cake with gelato and fresh whipped cream. We had several cocktails as well that were unique as well as strong. Not only was our server super attentive and well versed in menu options, the owner Johnny checked in to make sure everything was satisfactory and appreciated our patronage so much that he offered is a complimentary glass of port as a parting gift. That's service!!! We'll definitely be back."," We shared a bunch of stuff: a perfectly medium cooked skirt steak with ""fries"" (really, just slices of baked potato) and baby arugula salad, blue crab stuffed ravioli (seriously, it was insane) as well as a flour less chocolate cake with gelato and fresh whipped cream.

"My husband and I picked Locale for our first post-baby date.  Given that we hadn't been out as just the two of us in over eight months, we were really hoping for a nice meal.  Locale didn't disappoint, but it didn't completely wow us either.We had the fried artichokes and meatballs as our appetizer course, both of which were nice.  Then we had the pappardelle with lamb ragout and the veal medallions with mushrooms for our entrees, which were, again, nice.  They offered a fried banana with ice cream and caramel sauce for dessert--it, too, was nice.  Nice, nice, nice.The physical space is nice, cozy, and feels like a slice of Brooklyn in Queens.  Some of the ironwork reminded me of Dressler.  We'll be back sometime, I think, but it's not my very first priority the next time we hire a babysitter."," My husband and I picked Locale for our first post-baby date.

"Awesome music.  Radiohead, Daft Punk, Janet Jackson.  Each employee is allowed to add songs to the playlist each night, so they must have some cool people working here, or at least some okay people who listen to good music.  Our waitress recited the specials without error, and gave great food recommendations.The special tomato-red pepper soup was delicious, but too big of a helping for an appetizer.  I enjoyed both of the pasta choices that my table ordered, but probably wouldn't get them again.  The rabbit ragu and pea prosciutto dishes were well executed, but just didn't mesh with my palette enough.Next time I go back I'm just going to do drinks and dessert, since I missed both of them the first time.  Chocolate souffle, here I come."," enjoy Each employee is allowed to add songs to the playlist each night, so they must have some cool people working here, or at least some okay people who listen to good music.

"I went to Locale for brunch this saturday...and I loved it!  I had the Portabello Benedict- poached eggs, spinach, and portabello mushrooms with a truffled hollandaise!  Amazing!  The home fries were great as well.  My friend had 2 eggs your way (she had them over-medium, but they weren't quite there, I think).  She commented how great it was to get any-style eggs in this neighborhood... She's had a hard time with that.  The service was great.  Very attentive, and very quick.  I never had an empty coffee cup!This is definitely our new brunch spot.  Next time I want to get a table in the VIP section...ours by the window was a little bit small, and a little drafty on a cold day.

"Pretty sure that this is my new favorite brunch place.  I ordered eggs benedict with corned beef hash and my friend had french toast filled with Nutella.  Both were delicious.  The only thing that I didn't really love was the consistency of the corned beef hash - I thought it was going to be crispy but it was mushy because it was in between the egg and the bread.  They would have received 5 stars had it not been for the tiny mimosa.  If you're going to charge that much for a drink, please make sure that it is more than 4 sips.  The food alone is worth it though!"," Pretty sure that this is my new favorite brunch place.

"Creative and scrumptious, Locale is so delicious, I am longing to return for the brusel sprout salad, tender crisp lamb ribs and spicy chicken on a large medley of seasonal vegetables. Cooked to perfection, common poultry is redefined. I have had dinner five times since the restaurant has new owners. Each time I have come with different friends and the response has been the same gutteral groans of dining pleasure. mmmmnnnn!!! ...and again MMMMNNN!    Oozing with charm,Locale looks like a 19th century European cafe frequented by Emile Zola and Cezanne. A great date place, it's romantic and edgy, and if there is a lull in the conversation, you can talk about the silent movies projected on the wall, a nod to Kaufamn Movie Studios down the block. Dracula and Vampires for Halloween, Fred Astair and Ginger Rogers for Valentine's day.      Brunch and dinner outside during the Indian summer was a joy,  sitting under the tall trees in the fresh air with the waitstaff graciously and patiently attending to our every culinary need. A great respite from the hectic Manhattan scene, and five minutes over the 59th street bridge. It cost more in a taxi to go downtown."," Creative and scrumptious, Locale is so delicious, I am longing to return for the brusel sprout salad, tender crisp lamb ribs and spicy chicken on a large medley of seasonal vegetables.

"Went to Locale last night with my girlfriend and her 8 year old son. Other than the kid being a bit bored (big surprise) the whole experience was great! Nice ambience, friendly helpful staff, hip vibe...... But the real win of the evening was the cuisine. Man, I tell you each treat they brought out was more tasty than the last. Appetizer of fried zucchini strips (like veggie fries) was so good, we had to slow down for the entree. I had the rigatoni, which was great, the lil guy had the gnocchi, delish......

"Went here for a Sunday brunch in the rain.Nice interior very loungy and comfortable for a relaxing brunch.  Come hungry!  Brunch portions are substantial.Had a hot tea to counteract the rain.  It was just a tea bag in water, nothing else to say about that.My friend got the corned beef hash and it was every bit indulgent and mildly repulsive as she was expecting.  I guess ordering that is more of a southern thing and her bf doesn't know 1, how she can eat it and 2, how come she likes it so much.I got the portobello benedict.  Nothing to write home about, but Definitely get the sauce on the side!  It's tangy and potent and i wasn't really a fan.  If you don't get it on the side it will take over your plate and attack any kind of food flavors that are out in the open.  We actually had very attentive service and the host made sure we didn't forget our umbrellas as were were heading out into the mugginess that followed."," Sunday brunch Brunch portions are substantial.Had a hot tea to counteract the rain.

"I'm basing my rating purely on their Brunch, since I've never had dinner here.But man, what a brunch menu.  All of the omelettes and eggs benedict are amazing.  My favorite though, is the texas toast.  It's basically french toast with a cornflake coating.  It's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, served with fresh fruit and just the right amount of syrup.If anyone brings up brunch, I bring them to Locale.", All of the omelettes and eggs benedict are amazing It's basically french toast with a cornflake coating.
"Purdy Fantastic Brunch!Been living around the corner for over a year and just ate here yesterday, I've got to say I was quite impressed on a number of levels.We stopped in for brunch and I did the Southern Omelet (substituted some awesome Polish sausage for the grilled chicken) and the thing was enormous and was a real winner in the flavor department! The homefries will leave you agape. My g/f got the tuna & avocado club with some pretty bomb bacon and fries that were very very tasty and crisp. Additionally to all the tastiness the service was quite special. The waitress was quite funny and very attentive. The owner (or manager or whatever the hell he was) came over to see how our experience was. It was touching. . . I was expecting to pay a small fortune for all this deliciousness but we got out of there for less than $30 (without booze, we were quite hungover).

My go-to Saturday brunch spot. The best eggs benedict I've found in Astoria! I've always been seated quickly and service is always friendly. They trimmed back their brunch menu however and I'm pretty bummed that they took the steak off.,
"Wow! The  staff were really excited about their new fall menu and now I know why. The salmon with lobster gnocchi was out of this world! One of those dishes that will make you want to slowly savor the experience. It's worth the splurge $ wise, trust me. Only thing to avoid - cocktails with ice in it. They over-ice the drinks so you pay too much for about 5 sips. Go for the wine options. So good!", One of those dishes that will make you want to slowly savor the experience Go for the wine options So good

"Locale makes GREAT pasta. I have been here a few times, and every pasta dish I have tried has been amazing. Unfortunately, everything else I've had there has been somewhere between mediocre and bad.The meat they use there is organic. If you know anything about organic meat, you know that the cows are not as fat as regular cows. While this is great for the cows, it is not as great for merciless carnivores like me. This is not a failing of the preparation, but there's a reason Peter Luger does not serve organic meat.The fish is usually salty and over sauced. In Astoria, there are a slew of Greek places that will give you a simply grilled fish covered in olive oil, lemon, and thyme. I find that preferable to the fish dishes I've tried at Locale.I've had a few of their appetizers too, which range from forgettable (I can't remember which ones, ha ha), to pretty horrible (fried artichokes tasted like fried nothing).But really, the pasta there is GREAT. The faggotini is really worth popping in for if you live nearby, as is the garganelli. This place is two different restaurants: a great pasta place, and a pretty crappy everything else place."," Locale makes GREAT pasta.

They seated us in the front close to the window and I sat on the bench by the window with the pretty pillows. We ordered the house salad, calamari for appetizers. I ordered the risotto and my boyfriend ordered the gnocchi.  I wished I had read the reviews. This place is apparently good for pasta. My risotto was bland and the calamari was overcooked.

We like Locale a great deal....one of the nicer places on that northern NJ Piermont Rd corridor. One note to consider if you dine al fresco.....most of the chairs are terribly uncomfortable.

"Extremely disappointed with Locale.  It caught my eye as a cool spot that I wanted to try, but the food and service was sub par.We ordered drinks at the bar while we waited for a table.  While we were drinking our cocktails a waitress came by and grabbed the glass of water that was served to me and brought it to someone else.  Eww!  Luckily I didn't drink it, but that was gross.  Maybe an honest mistake, but don't know how that could have happened.We were seated at a table outside on the sidewalk.  Shared the fried zucchini which was ok and crab cakes which were good.  For an entree I had the gnocchi.  Possibly the worst I've ever had.  The sauce was sooooo nasty.  I don't know if I will ever be back.  I will refrain from ripping them further as there is more I could add.  My sister-in-law warned me it was only good for drinks, but I was hoping she was wrong.  Safe to say she was right.  It makes me think twice about possibly trying their other business venture, Lucas Steakhouse."," Extremely disappointed with Locale The sauce was sooooo nasty.

"I've been here a few times for both brunch and dinner and I have to say, this place is solidly good.There usually isn't a wait for this place so no need to make a reservation, but you can if you want to.  The service is friendly and quick to respond.  The restaurant is actually on a great corner with outdoor seating (if the weather is nice) and huge windows in the front that they'll open up sometimes.  It's a semi romantic setting at night with dim lights.The food is good.  Their french toast for brunch is delicious.  All their pastas are also really solid and tasty.  The food comes out at a good pace.  They do have good drinks, but in my opinion, they are kind of pricey.  They have a great space in the back of the restaurant that would probably be be great for a  little party or shower.As a note though, if you have a restaurant.com certificate for here, they won't honor it...a little unfortunate that they only comp'ed one dessert...but people have to make a living I guess."," I've been here a few times for both brunch and dinner and I have to say, this place is solidly good.There usually isn't a wait for this place so no need to make a reservation, but you can if you want to.

"I recently moved to the neighborhood with my family and have lived in Manhattan for over 20yrs but knew only little about Astoria's food scene. This past week my wife and I, along with two Astoria natives decided to check out some of the local places. I was really disappointed with this one. Food was borderline o.k. and WAY over priced for the quality, but service was descent. The place looks charming but did not deliver in the food and beverage department. NY Strip was over cooked and simply boring; as if my kids had made one for the first time without supervision. The Locale Mojito seemed like a safe bet, but was overpowered by the st Germain and not very cold. I suspect it was sitting there for a while. We did not finish our plates and decided to head elsewhere for a night cap. I decided to write my first review today and saw that all of my complaints were mirrored on yelp by previous guests. Then I read a very interesting review by a local couple on their blog (see: Elizabeth S. 7/15/2012) and saw the response it got from Locale's owner.

"I've been here several times over the past 5 years of living in the area. I would have rated this much higher if not for my most recent experience. I was here with a friend last week, and the food as always is excellent. The service was not though. My friend ordered from the pre-fixe menu for restaurant week, I ordered off the regular menu yet they charged the mandatory 18.75% gratuity on the whole bill. The waitress's service was AWFUL. I think mandatory tipping is BS because it opens up to being ignored like we were. She didn't check how our food was, ask us if we wanted more drinks and my friend had wanted ketchup for her meal, yet it took over 10 minutes to get the waitress to even notice we needed something.Some other lady started coming by and we continued to try and enjoy each other's company and ignore the poor service. Finally AFTER we paid the bill, the second lady who was coming around asked if everything was okay and we said it was fine, and tried to continue talking amongst ourselves. She then pointed out that she is the manager and we seem dissatisfied because we aren't making eye contact. I didn't realize we were here to be your friend! This woman was very abrasive. Then we told her we felt our waitress was a bit aloof. ""Aloof?"" she asks. I didn't realize that word was too big for a high class manager such as yourself. She continued to barrage us, why didn't you say something, why aren't you looking at us when we come over etc etc. Listen lady, we weren't there to be your friends. You people are called servers for a reason, you're there to serve us our food, make sure we have what we need then get lost. Try it sometimes. Don't come to our table after we ate, and paid to make sure everything is alright then act like a superior b*tch because you're the oh-so-important manager. If she noticed we didn't seem happy, she should have addressed it right when she noticed by introducing herself as the manager and asking if everything was alright, like they do IN EVERY OTHER RESTAURANT in the world.

"My friends and I had brunch here just yesterday for my birthday and it was so phenomenal! I was surprised that there was no wait on a Sunday while the  soccer game was on. We were seated right away ( outside on a beautiful day) and then our waitress came over and introduced herself - Anna! If you want excellent and quick customer service, she's your girl! She helped us out with what we should get since it was our first time, she was honest, friendly and way too sweet! We all ended up getting different things and all tried something new, I had the baby spinach and goat cheese omelet with their potato wedges (fries). It was so amazing, it was hot and it had the right amount of cheese and spinach, not too overwhelming. My friend got the avocado turkey club which was also so delicious! My other friend got the chicken omelet and she honestly scarfed it down in 5 minutes! We had a round of mimosas, and those were gone before we finished making the toast. They have mango, passion and regular mimosas. Then we had a round of sangria, which was also, so great. It wasn't too sweet or bitter (just wish the fruit was a little fresher). We ordered creme brûlée for dessert and Anna came out with a candle on it since she over heard it was my birthday! & it was on the house!

I re-visited locale for dinner last month and was pleasantly surprised at the comeback they had made with their service and food. We were seated and served promptly and all our dishes were exquisite. If they keep up this level locale will be around for years to come., We were seated and served promptly and all our dishes were exquisite.
"Came here for some delicious brunch - I was told that it may be the second best place for brunch in Astoria. I've yet to be some place better, so it's number one to me!Typical brunch fare, ran until 4pm the day we were there. Drinks are either a little weak or I'm a closet alcoholic or something. Portion sizes were perfect for breakfast - I do not need a monster omelet bringing terror to my stomach in the mornings, thank you. The home fries were the most unusual I've ever encountered - potato chunks with onion and other veggies, all nicely baked and not greasy. Service was good and on top of things. Always a pleasant addition to brunching fare."," Came here for some delicious brunch - I was told that it may be the second best place for brunch in Astoria.

"I used to come here often since my girlfriend lived on the same block. The sandwiches for Sunday brunch are amazing, and the fries are some of the tastiest I've ever had.Dinner is another story. None of the seating is comfortable, but if you're stuck in the lounge area, prepare to feel awkward. The pasta was mediocre, with odd peas. The waiters are inconsistent, too.

The girl at the bar NEVER looked up at us to ask us if we wanted anything to drink. I eventually had to ask her if she could get us something. She was RUDE. Not once making eye contact. Not a great first impression. We ordered the chicken? omelet and crepe special. The crepe special for the price was extremely tiny and filled with almost nothing. As for the omelet, I like my eggs fluffy but this batch tasted fake. Like air; no taste, no substance, no filling, so weird. The home fries were good but the portion was small.

"I have been in Astoria for a few years now and have been to Locale on a few different occasions. First let me say that the quality is really second to none. I have never had a bad meal at Locale and the interior and vibe are really spot on. But if I was to offer a critique on the menu itself I have noticed a lack of diversity on the menu. I think that the menu is a little bogged down with pastas and though I have enjoyed the risotto, I traditionally think of it as a special or seasonal dish. Also, I'm not a big fan of drinks that  you have to point to because they are trying to be funny (i.e.thepantydropper) though the beverage itself is pretty tasty.But all in all, Locale is a great restaurant and a must visit if you are in the Astoria food scene. The environment is modern but comfortable and the staff is really pleasant and attentive."," enjoy First let me say that the quality is really second to none.

I ordered the poached eggs with biscuits and gravy. Sucked. portion was extremely small, food not hot, gravy bland, biscuits dense and flavorless. Only thing enjoyable about my meal was the homefries. my sister got the cali benedict, for $12 a SMALL english muffin with weak slices of avocado, non-ripe tomato slices, and some weird watery sauce. not appetizing at all.Lastly the service is terrible.

Not only is the environment, depending on where you sit, comfortable and elegant at the same time, but frankly, the quality of the food has improved over time, particularly the omelets and egg benedicts. It's especially nice when it's warm out. They mostly have the usual breakfast and brunch fare plus somewhat unique additions (polenta with sausage and fried egg), but it is a slim menu.

"I've been to Locale a few times and have never been disappointed. The lobster ravioli was delicious! Unfortunately, I don't believe it's on the menu anymore. The Peanut Butter Bomba was the best guilty treat I ever had! I highly recommend this place to have a martini with friends or to go on a romantic date. I've also heard good things about their brunch. The location of this place is in a very unusual spot in the middle of bodegas and whatnot, but I think business does just fine."," The lobster ravioli was delicious!

"I am impressed by Locale's prompt and caring management - since my last review, I was able to speak with a manager who was super helpful, kind, and attentive to the problem at hand. I am so glad since like I mentioned, the food there is really amazing as is the decor and table service. I'm so happy now to see that Locale really does care about their customers. Their food (and cake cutting fee...) may be somewhat on the more expensive side (except brunch) but for the most part, it is worth it.

"One star is based on atmosphere and service only. I did not eat here.I made a reservation on a Friday night for two to eat outside at 8:30. When I got there, they did not have my reservation, and happened to have one table available outside with only one chair. I waited for them to bring another chair, and someone walked by and asked if we wanted tap or bottled water. When they brought the second chair, we waited without menus or table settings for about three minutes, and someone else walked by and asked if we wanted tap or bottled water. I again replied ""tap,"" and we waited another five minutes. While we waited, we noticed how incredibly loud it was. My boyfriend couldn't even hear me at a normal voice level even though we were outside. Servers walked by repeatedly, and no one else stopped at our table to greet us, give us menus or to tell us how long it would be until our server would be there. Ten minutes after we arrived, we were already regretting our restaurant choice at this point so we left."," Servers walked by repeatedly, and no one else stopped at our table to greet us, give us menus or to tell us how long it would be until our server would be there."
i love the decor of this restaurant. we had the black linguini and it was the best ive ever had. the hanger steak was also good but we both felt that nobody  beats peter lugers when it comes to steaks,

Delish! I enjoyed some shoestring zuccini bites and an espresso martini to die for tonight at Locale. I've lived in the neighborhood for 2.5 years and I just discovered this place through a friend. I will definitely be coming back for drinks - the beer selection is excellent!, enjoy I will definitely be coming back for drinks - the beer selection is excellent!
"This is more of a 3 1/2 to 4 star review. I feel like 3 little stars isn't very fair, but anyway..Decided to try Locale for dinner the other night, since I was pretty optimistic about it after I had looked up their menu online.I made a reservation for a Friday night at 8:30- we were running 10 mins late so I called ahead to notify the restaurant, and they gracefully accommodated us. Instead of our usual beer, my husband and I opted for wine this time around- he had the Chardonnay and I had the Pino Grigio...he complained that the Chardonnay tasted as if it was ""watered down"" and it did lack alot of flavor. He got the Sauvignon Blanc in place of it, which was a little bit better, but nothing really that great. The Pino was kinda along the same lines. Our server suggested the Calamari as an excellent starter, and although I wanted to try something different for a change, we decided to go with it since she said it was really good. It was good, but it was also just like any other calamari I've had at any other place. I've also had calamari that was alot better than that too. Not a huge disappointment, but not exactly exciting either...We followed that with pasta, my husband getting the Lamb Paperdelle, and I got the artichoke/asparagus stuffed Ravioli with a cream sauce. The pastas were great, and I appreciate the ""proper"" portions that were served, but for the prices of $16 and $19, I would expect a bit more for my money, or for the prices to be a bit lower. Service was very attentive and the restaurant has a warm and cozy atmosphere. Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, it just wasn't anything very exciting."," I feel like 3 little stars isn't very fair, but anyway..Decided to try Locale for dinner the other night, since I was pretty optimistic about it after I had looked up their menu online.I made a reservation for a Friday night at 8:30- we were running 10 mins late so I called ahead to notify the restaurant, and they gracefully accommodated us.

"I've since been here for brunch, multiple times for dinner and twice for a night cap. I am DEFINITELY hooked! When you go, you must save room for the peanut butter bomba.

Words cannot describe..."," I am DEFINITELY hooked When you go, you must save room for the peanut butter bomba."

"I went to  Locale for brunch.  I had a delicious omelette, the  Texas toast with nutella, and a body Mary.  The Texas toast was amazing.  It had just the right amount of nutella for an indulgent brunch dessert without being overwhelming.  Too much sweetness in the morning makes me feel sick, but the toast was fantastic.  The bloody Mary had a LOT of kick.  It was a lot of spice initially, but it disappeared just as quickly as it hit. I liked it a  lot. The fact that there was no lingering  bite made it easier to handle.  Also the decor is awesome.  It's cozy and classy and I love it!"," The Texas toast was amazing The Texas toast was amazing Too much sweetness in the morning makes me feel sick, but the toast was fantastic."

"My friend and I came here on a rainy week day for brunch. From the street, I think I walked past this place like 4x before I realized the restaurant on the corner with the red awning was Gastroteca..LOL I didn't see a sign or anything that said Gastroteca on it..OR perhaps I need to open my eyes more.. O_O Interior decor was simple and clean. I really liked the open layout and that the tables weren't so close together. For food, we ordered the California Benedict, Scampi & Grits, and we had the 3 for $10 Crostinos (Fig Jam, Ricotta, Prosciutto/Sicilian Pineapple, Mascarpone, Chili Flakes/Tallegio, Pistachio, Blackberry Jam), and I also ordered a side dish of cheddar polenta. My friend also ordered a Bold Fashioned from the cocktail menu. Food came out fairly quickly. First came out the apps, which were the crostinos. My favorite was the Sicilian Pineapple w/ Mascarpone & Chili flakes. Each bite was very flavorful and tasty. I didn't really care for the Tallegio, Pistachio & Blackberry jam though. I didn't think that flavor combination worked well. My California Benedict was delicious! 2 perfectly cooked eggs and coupled with the avocado and basil really worked! My friend's Scampi & Grits tasted good too. I didn't really care for the cheddar polenta. I thought the polenta was a bit clumpy and could have use just a little more cooking. Portions are good, and quality is definitely there. My friend did complain about her Bold Fashioned though. She felt that the crushed blackberries on the bottom of the glass made drinking out of a straw rather difficult. Otherwise, it tasted pretty good. Service was on point. Server was very knowledgeable about the menu and their food. Very patient as well. I can see Gastroteca being one of my go-to brunch spots! :D"," From the street, I think I walked past this place like 4x before I realized the restaurant on the corner with the red awning was Gastroteca..LOL I didn't see a sign or anything that said Gastroteca on it..OR perhaps I need to open my eyes more..

Very nice place near Kaufman studios and The Museum of the Moving Image.  Inside was airy and very bright.  I had the chicken and waffles (as good as sweet chick) and will have to come back for the burrata.  Lexi was very friendly and very attentive.  I chose to eat outside in front and was pleasantly ensconced by the warm sun for most of my meal.  Cars can be a little noisy but it is New York., Inside was airy and very bright.
"Went on a whim on a Tuesday afternoon for brunch and really liked the food and atmosphere. A rustic decor with large windows to let in natural light and 80s rock playing in the background. I ordered the Brunch Lasagna. It was good. Not bad but I had better. But my girlfriend ordered the Bucatini Americano and it was delicious. A must have on the weekday brunch menu.We also ordered crostinos: the prosciutto/ricotta/fig jam, agrodolce bacon/scallion ricotta, and tallegio/pistachios/blackberry jam. My favorite was the bacon. It balanced sweet and savory very well with the smoky meat and a drizzle of balsamic. The girlfriend liked the tallegio because of the light but tasty blackberry jam.

Scampi was really good to mix with the creamy cheese, the shrimp wasn't over cook, !! It was fantastic. But the brunch lasagna was so so, the lasagna layer had more to do with toughness and it served with warm temperature only, I believe it will taste much better if they serve it hot."," The food was good but they took more than half hr to serve the food, even there was few tables only.

"Ok, I ordered the California Benedict with a side salad and all I can say is that those egg Benedict's were really good! The side salad was just lettuce and vinaigrette dressing; refreshing but not satisfying or very tasty (next time I'll try the hash browns since they seemed to be the popular side that day). My husband ordered the gnocchi and I must admit that's probably the best gnocchi I've tasted! One downside is that the portion size is very small and I would recommend ordering one or two sides because the gnocchi by itself was not filling for my husband. We also had delicious mimosas and a friendly bar tender! We would definitely try this place again but not too often since it is expensive for us."," Ok, I ordered the California Benedict with a side salad and all I can say is that those egg Benedict's were really good!

"Nice little spot near Kaufman theater.  A bit nosier than I expected but nice music and vibe.We got the texan french toast with nutella and Atlantic salmon with runny eggs.  The crispy flakes of the french toast was really good with every sweet bite of nutella.  The powder sugar was just sweet enough, then to dip just a bit of the toast in the syrup to really change it.  The home fries we got with the salmon was a nice salty and sweet combo.  The runny eggs with salmon was really a nice pair the toast was a bit hard but the runny egg helps soften it up.  Small spot but some good lighting and atmosphere makes a good time.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  I would have to go try some of the other stuff another time =)As always check some of the photos that I always post =)"," Nice little spot near Kaufman theater The crispy flakes of the french toast was really good with every sweet bite of nutella.

"I really wanted to love Gastroteca. I've walked past it so many times and always thought it looked charming. Finally my fiance and I tried it today for brunch. Sadly there were a lot of low points during our meal.First impression: it's loud. Plenty of people chatting and on top of that loud music. I'm not a fan of loud music in restaurants that makes it hard to talk. After sitting down we waited almost ten minutes for anyone to notice us. My fiance ordered a cocktail that was delivered in a dirty glass. We had to wait over 20 minutes to have it changed, and the cocktail fell very short of its description. We barely saw our waiter and the other staff members seemed inexperienced. When my fiance's cocktail was changed a different waiter brought him a replacement. Since he whisked away the old one so fast we didn't get a chance to tell him what we ordered. When he came back with another cocktail we asked him if it was a WINter (the cocktail we originally ordered). He just shrugged. How do you now know what drink you brought us?We never saw a waiter other than to deliver food or to pick up empty glasses. No one came by to see how we were doing. Clearly, the waitstaff isn't used to circulating the room.The food itself was fine, but not spectacular. My mushroom omelet was a fine omelet but the fries on the side were greasy and limp. My fiance's brunch lasagna had underdone pasta and was rather dry (not surprising as there's no real sauce to speak of) and small. It needed something else, even something as simple as a side salad. The zeppoles were very tasty and quite dense/rich, probably the best part of our meal. All in all, I don't need to go back to Gastroteca. I can make myself an omelet (and frankly, a better french fry) and my home has a calmer atmosphere. I think if the staff were to get a better handle on service this place could be much better."," I've walked past it so many times and always thought it looked charming.

"Ordered a California eggs benedict with home fries and a garlic-jalepeño bloody mary (it had some cute name but I forget). Service was good, food was very nicely prepared. Nothing to complain about but nothing remarkable either - pretty much what you would expect for the price point. The bloody Mary was disappointing. Lots of spice but not enough flavor & sort of watery. Served with pickled cauliflower, which was nice but really could have used some quality large green olives. It was not loud in there, definitely easy have a conversation and catch up with a friend. Atmosphere was spacious yet cozy and cute, not an easy combo to pull off. I would definitely go again. I would try a different drink."," Service was good, food was very nicely prepared. Nothing to complain about but nothing remarkable either - pretty much what you would expect for the price point.

"The drinks here are STRONG. I came for brunch and had a shandy followed by two Moscow Mules and was definitely feeling the after effects, so don't let the cocktail prices set you off even though brunch drinks are typically a little cheaper.My friends got the fried chicken and waffles and the chicken sandwich, all of which were devoured. I got the fried eggplant and burrata sandwich, which was great. I think next time I'll ask for a little extra sauce. I felt there were a ton of greens on the sandwich, but not enough sauce and burrata to add to the mix. Something to consider if you like your eggplant extra sauce-y. Our server was really attentive, and I loved sitting next to the big front windows. Will definitely be back now that the sun is starting to come out, and they have some outdoor seating.

Their Mmm mmm mimosa was perfect, their homemade Bloody Mary even passed my boyfriend's standards, and the food was incredible. It had some nice outdoor seating and I appreciated the 90s/00s pop music that brought me back to childhood. I very much appreciated that they were screening The Magic School Bus inside behind the bar.

"We stopped in before catching a movie on a chilly Saturday afternoon and were kinda surprised to see the place nearly full at 3pm. (Based on the Yelp reviews and our experience here, Gastroteca is a popular spot for events with large groups. On our day, it was somebody's 30th birthday and there was cake with sparklers.) We were seated right away, but grabbed the last spot in the house so otherwise we would've waited. Once we were seated, though, the experience was lightning fast. Our server was impressively speedy, which worked well for us because we were in a hurry, but I do wonder if this is a good place for a languid brunch.I decided to try the scampi & grits (shrimp, sausage, tomato, peppers, polenta, eggs). A note about the scampi: the sauce on this dish is not the garlicky butter sauce common to shrimp scampi dishes in the U.S. Instead, it has a meaty red sauce. Regardless, this is a great dish in terms of quality: the ingredients were quite fresh, the poached eggs oozed nicely onto the scampi, and the flavors mixed together well. It wasn't the most exciting thing in the world, however, and I found myself somewhat envying my boyfriend's brunch lasagna (béchamel, bacon, sausage, spinach, mozzarella, fried egg), which is really a unique concoction. I only had one bite, but the uncommon béchamel as a substitute for lasagna's red sauce was memorable. I also had a coffee cocktail, since I wanted both coffee and a cocktail. Unfortunately this isn't on the online menu, so I can't relay the exact ingredients. It was a tasty, if fairly standard, cold coffee liqueur drink. 3.5 stars."," (Based on the Yelp reviews and our experience here, Gastroteca is a popular spot for events with large groups.

"I'm embarrassed to say I have lived in Astoria for 3 years and just FINALLY went to Locale for dinner. It was Valentine's Day so they had a prix frixe menu for $60. Now, I normally wouldn't want to spend that much for my dinner (it is a recession, after all and I AM unemployed currently) however, I loved being forced to get an appetizer, entree, dessert and coffee. All the food was really good. I started with beef tartare which came with some delicious spicy mustard and got a fruit tart for dessert. I had fresh red linguini with jumbo shrimp as my main course (YUM) and got a pineapple mojito to drink (also YUM). The coffee at the end was a HUGE cup for the end of the night but I wasn't complaining. The one downside, food-wise, was my boyfriend's steak wasn't rare at all despite ordering it medium rare and them apparently being kind of a ""steak place."" That was a bummer but it did seem like the steak would have been delicious if it were actually rare. The restaurant itself is very cute and definitely highlighted for me how young Astoria as a neighborhood really is (or is getting). It's pretty small but we had a seat by the window so didn't have to sit in tables right next to each other. I can't wait to go back in summer to sit outside and try the margaritas that a friend has always recommended to me."," All the food was really good.

"Came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday night. We sat in the lounge area since we didn't make reservations. Lounge area was fine though! except you had to bend over your food a bit. Our waiter was very nice. We resisted the temptation to get appetizers. But we did get bread... and I seriously loved the bread. I love bread in general, but those breadsticks... ghakejrhg. Anyway... just bread, but I loved it. I ordered the gnocchi and my boyfrend ordered the lemon chicken. Both dishes were awesome. Just the right portions too. Whenever I order gnocchi I get this enormous portion that ends up just making me sick because I can't stop eating it. But this was perfect :D covered in lots of mozzarella. Overall, I enjoyed the food, and I saw other items on the menu I wanted to try, so I will definitely be going back!"," enjoy Came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday night except you had to bend over your food a bit Our waiter was very nice.

I'll start with the cons - best to be upfront about these things.  The wine list is weak and the food is not memorable. BUT the service and atmosphere are seriously worth it.

My first visit will be my last at Locale. The service was so slow (we probably had three or four different servers throughout the meal and still didnt have great service!) and the food took about 45 minutes to arrive.

"This place never fails to let me down.  I have gone there many times for many different occasions ... casual Sunday brunch, dinner dates, Saturday night cocktails, and the atmosphere is flexible for all. The food is amazing and the portions are the perfect size, not too small and ""foofy"" and not so abundant where it is wasteful.  The steak special is to die for, artichoke ravioli is fantastic, a blueberry martini was superb. I also recommend the beet and goat cheese salad. One time I was there and the food took way too long and they made up for it with complimentary wine which was awesome."," Sunday brunch I have gone there many times for many different occasions ... casual Sunday brunch, dinner dates, Saturday night cocktails, and the atmosphere is flexible for all.

"Had dinner with a friend here on Saturday evening. The location and the ambiance of the restaurant is fantastic. Perfect for outdoor dining. For appetizer, we ordered fried long stemmed artichoke hearts. They were delicious! The artichokes were lightly friend and still juicy on the inside. It came on a bed of arugula and this delicious white sauce. My entree, i chose organic lemon chicken. Once again, it was delicious. The chicken was perfectly seared and cooked. I normally don't order chicken at restaurants b/c it can be bland, but the salt and flavor was just right. My friend wasn't too happy with her dish however. She ordered the squid ink pasta dish. She was happy with the taste of her dish, however the portions were too small for her liking. My only complaint was the pricing. I felt like the bill came out a little too high considering it's a neighborhood restaurant in Astoria. I would still come back though, especially to try their brunch!"," Had dinner with a friend here on Saturday evening The location and the ambiance of the restaurant is fantastic.

"Meh, indeed. Mediocre all around. For brunch, at least. The eggs Benedict was served with a soft-boiled rather than poached egg. Wrong! Lazy, at best.There's little variety on the menu. This is not a problem if you do a select few dishes extremely well, but that's not the case at Locale. It's an interesting space if not entirely comfortable and the service was not bad. I really liked the music selection, but that should not be the main draw of a brunch place.", Mediocre all around It's an interesting space if not entirely comfortable and the service was not bad.
"After living in the area for nearly 5 years this was hands down my favorite place to eat in the neighborhood. I've never encountered a bad experience. Always a jaw dropping selection of specials, great food, friendly service, reasonable prices given the quality, and nice atmosphere. A few people commented on the brunch, I've had the brunch once or twice and its definitely not as strong as their dinner menu, but I don't think of Local as a brunch place so its not really considered in my 5 starer.",
"Woke up to have brunch this morning in a group of 8 with no reservations. Yes, silly - I know.. however, we dropped by Locale and they were able to seat us within 20 mins. We started with Mimosas and Cappuccinos all around and within 15 - 20 mins our orders were coming out. I order the eggs benedict and my husband had the corned beef hash benedict. Yummy! Around the table, were orders of pancakes and burgers. Everyone loved the fresh food and it was a great atmosphere. It wasn't' too loud where we had to shout, but there was a little hustle and bustle, which I didn't mind at all. I saw groups of 4-6 all around and loved the cozy decor. I think this place is still a hidden and quaint local spot in Astoria and hope that we can still drop by, with no reservations, on any given morning with the same greeting and amazing food/service. Can't wait to come back in a bit when it's warmer to enjoy the outside seating! :)"," Yum enjoy Woke up to have brunch this morning in a group of 8 with no reservations Everyone loved the fresh food and it was a great atmosphere.

"I've never been disappointed with Locale. I've been wowed a few times and safisfied the rest with my meal and the service. As a rule and somewhat habit I always get their fish specials- the fish is always cooked perfectly and has a sauce that always compliments the natural flavor instead of masking it. The portions are always just perfect, and the presentation is always very stunning. If you're in the neighborhood and want a nice meal, definitely stop by!",
"Locale is a beautifully decorated corner  haunt, just for the ""locals""...don't expect quick service, or consistency, but there is a ""homey-ness"" about the place that makes it a comfortable go to bar in the middle of Astoria. Everyone is as pleasant as pie... and the wine list isn't that bad either...",
"One additional thing i noticed about this place is that there's a huge mirror above the bar, tilted downwards, perfect for spying down your date's shirt. Yeah, I'm like 12... deal with it.",
"As Astoria begins to gentrify due to the onslaught of hipsters, ex-Wallstreet employees and the rest move out of the increasingly expensive city places like the trendy Locale being to pop up. With that being said this place does like up to the hype and the higher than normal prices are justified by the food. Last time I came here it was early summer and I ordered a glass of red wine with some black linguini in squid sauce tossed with seafood. The meal was exceptional, tasty and hot on arrival. The waiter service was sub-par and for that I can't give this place a 5 star rating. As the neighborhood continues to evolve as a second LIC I believe that Locale with become a hot spot so come down before it's over-run or played out."," As Astoria begins to gentrify due to the onslaught of hipsters, ex-Wallstreet employees and the rest move out of the increasingly expensive city places like the trendy Locale being to pop up.

"I'll admit the brunch can be hit or miss. The first time I went it was great. The second time not so much although it was mothers day and they were slammed and their credit card machine was down. The only thing that miffed me that trip was that it clearly says at the top of the brunch menu that a mimosa or bloody mary was included in the prix fixe brunch. Apparently not because the waitress charged us anyway and refused to take them off after we pointed out what was printed in black and white, her response was merely, ""We don't do that anymore.""Dinner is a different story though.

"I'd been to Locale before I even moved to the city, but this weekend was my first time back. The small restaurant is a few blocks off the subway line, tucked away in a residential part of Astoria. It has a great atmosphere that's a combination of restaurant and lounge, with a couches on an elevated area in the corner and floor-to-ceiling windows around the dining room. The restaurant was crowded, though I'd say it is a little pricey for the neighborhood, but the cuisine is definitely above average.We ordered the fried zucchini as an appetizer. It wasn't even on the menu, but our server suggested it, and we were pleased with the choice. The strips were lightly breaded and crispy, and not too greasy. There was a saucer of marinara sauce for dipping, but it was too chunky and the zucchini strips too thin to make it easy to dip into and get good 'coverage'. We also tried the crab cake, which was served with a dill sauce that I found to be a little overpowering, V liked it though. It wasn't that 'lumpy' but didn't seem to be loaded with much bread either.I ordered the seafood pasta which was served with a whole assortment of seafood: scallops, shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari and crab. There was a good amount of everything but some of it, like the scallops, was grainy. The pasta itself wasn't anything special, and the sauce wasn't quite what I expected, as it was rather thin. I had ordered the dish with a white sauce which was flavorful but thin, and didn't really stick to anything.Other times we've eaten at Locale the food was very good, and we tried tonight to keep the price down. I can imagine that at a restaurant like this you really get what you pay for, and there are some chef's specialties like the Mozzarella Olivata which is homemade cheese served hot with olives and tomatoes. It is distinctive and delicious. The restaurant has a great atmosphere, good crowd, good service and a unique take on the cuisine, I'll try it again sometime when my pocketbook can better take the hit."," The small restaurant is a few blocks off the subway line, tucked away in a residential part of Astoria.

"Went for brunch, had the special - omelet with broccoli Rabe and sweet sausage. Nothing spectacular but it was definitely good. The missus had the Benedict - again very good , but shy of something I would rave about and say you HAD to go and try. Nice atmosphere, prices I'd say average for the area. Should note we only went because cafe bar is closed for renovations. Glad I tried here finally and i would go back if someone wanted to go, but was happier at Fattys, flo and ovelia.

I've been here a couple times for brunch and dinner. At no point did this place ever  blow me away.  They season everything way to salty here.  Once I ordered an eggs benedict and the yolk was almost cook through.  I think this place wants to take food the second level but the entrees are always lacking in a certain something making the meal unmemorable.  If you don't have a palate and want to eat whatever this is the place to go., At no point did this place ever  blow me away

"Delicious Brunch menu. Fluffy, well cooked omelets, crispy bacon and of course mimosas. The mimosas/bellinis/bloody Marys are not included and are rather pricey in terms of drink per dollar. The mimosas were a bit small and light on the non-orange juice components. But overall, that was the most disappointing aspect of the meal. The southwestern omelet with jalapeno relish was quite good. Not too spicy, but adds just enough. The hash browns are intriguing. They come with peas and red peppers mixed in. Well seasoned though, so they earn points there.The atmosphere is nice. It feels like an upscale-ish sort of place, big glass windows, a separate eating area with more coffee-shop style cushions and low tables. A vaguely classical Greece/Rome motif adorns the walls, but overall, it's what you would expect from restaurant brunch, and non diner/Denny's brunch.The staff was friendly, and helpful.

"My friend who lives nearby told me how great this place was so we decided to eat here together.  I had a good feeling about Locale when I entered the restaurant.  Its open, modern decor exuded a bit of elegance mixed in with coziness which combined, made you feel welcome.  I ordered the calamari and the soup of the day, split pea while my friend orderd the tagliateIle with vegetables.  The split pea was incredible--having had split pea soups in the past, I felt this one was no ordinary soup. Let's say it had a rustic kick on top of that good ol' homecooked taste.  The calamari, though it was not that warm, was delicious due to its perfect crispiness and non greasy texture. My friend enjoyed her pasta thoroughly and continued to dabble on the sauce even though she finished her food.  We paired our food with the bottle of ""Katurna"", Croatian white wine and savored every sip until we were done. I plan on coming by to try their pasta dishes and soup again.  Its versatile furnishing and ambience are well suited for meals with a friend, group of friends/family, or a date and offers food for everyone-- foodies, meat lovers, vegetarians, pesceterians...well, you get the picture. However, don't expect huge portions of pasta here."," enjoy The split pea was incredible--having had split pea soups in the past, I felt this one was no ordinary soup.

"living in the area, i've passed by this place a bunch of times kept telling myself to check it out. the ambiance of the place seemed very nice - especially during the evenings when i always saw people sitting outside.so anyway, i finally had a chance to go there. i went to go eat brunch with a friend on a saturday morning and was surprised with how reasonable the prices were. sadly to say the least, my friend and i were not impressed at all with the actual food. i guess i'm a pretty picky eater, but seriously, the vegetables weren't fully cooked in our omelets! we didn't even finish our food - and us girls can eat!however, from the other reviews that i've read, and the fact that i live a block away from this place, i will have to give it another chance. possibly for dinner and drinks."," the ambiance of the place seemed very nice - especially during the evenings when i always saw people sitting outside.so anyway, i finally had a chance to go there. i guess i'm a pretty picky eater, but seriously, the vegetables weren't fully cooked in our omelets! we didn't even finish our food - and us girls can eat!however, from the other reviews that i've read, and the fact that i live a block away from this place, i will have to give it another chance. possibly for dinner and drinks"

"My first experience with the restaurant family was at the Lucas where I was floored by the prices (same as manhattan) but floored again by the service (best in astoria).  Our server Ryan was perfect with every nuance.  Needless to say I was excited to explore it's sister restaurant, Locale but much to my disappointment, the did not deliver.  We started  with the beet salad with the goat cheese puck(which we had at Lucas).  The difference was execution;  it was bland, the colors ran to the point that it looked like it was shaken to toss, and the worst part was the goat cheese pad was obviously microwaved in saran wrap (everyone knows the smell and how it dries out cheese) and not toasted.  the entrees were mediocre and very over priced (you pay for ambience, nice space) and the bartender (male) was somewhat snobby and unwilling to socialize.  I will only return for a glass of wine at the bar, will never spend another dime on that over showcased, overpriced food."," Our server Ryan was perfect with every nuance.

We waited 10-15 minutes just for the waitress to come after our meal was over, and she didn't bring the check until asked. Don't know if I'd come again."," Don't get me wrong, the food was good!

"Checked this place out for Sunday brunch and it was just okay. Their menu was decent - nothing too crazy. I thought the mimosa was very bland which was disappointing. We ordered the following:Italian fried chicken & buttermilk waffle - my first time having ""chicken and waffles"" combo and thought it was pretty good. The waffle itself was chewy and soft and the fried chicken was flavorful. It wasn't overwhelming in any way.                                                                                 Smoked Atlantic Salmon Crostino - ordered this after reading many reviews and scrolling through pictures.

"Was so pleasantly surprised by how good the food was. We got the lasagna and the maltagliati with pork ragu. At first glance it looks like it's in tomato paste but it wasn't, it was lighter than it looked in a mild flavored sauce. I ate the whole dish. We also had the straciatella with poached pear. It was delish. Could have used a bit more pear as the slice of bread was sizable but overall the crunch of the crostini was a nice surprise as at first it didn't look toasted. Yes, crostini should be but didn't look it. We also had the chocolate cake which had three great textures and flavors going for it minus the vanilla gelato. Very good! The waiter was terrific from the moment we sat till we left, just outstanding. Would give five stars but the food wasn't hot."," Could have used a bit more pear as the slice of bread was sizable but overall the crunch of the crostini was a nice surprise as at first it didn't look toasted.

"Went here for brunch on a Saturday. Got a seat right away which was really nice. Good menu with a variety of choices. Note they only have whole milk when ordering lattes which deterred me from ordering one but my brother got a mocha latte and enjoyed it.The spinach and goat cheese omelette was pretty good. The piece of toast and the home fries it came with were delicious. My brother said that his dish, the smoked salmon crostino, was spicy and ok.

Me and my fiancée went here for dinner and drinks and we both were very impressed. It's a great little Italian  restaurant in the heart of astoria. We started the night off with a few drinks. She had a lambrusco red wine and i had a Bold Fashion.(very strong lol)We ordered the fried calamari and you get a good portion for your money. The taste was very good and you can tell that the calamari was fresh. Our main course consisted of Cavatelli and Fruit De Mare Siciliano. My meal was very good with a good mixture of seafood and sauces. My fiancée meal was a good portion as well with a good blend of taste. The atmosphere was nice and low key- We happend to go and they were playing Back to the future on the projector screen lol which made my day. We also heard that every Thursday  is all night happy hour.  Definitely need to check that out.

"My parents and I were in town last week to go to the U.S. Open so I did a little yelping and decided to give this place a try.  We were all extremely pleased! We made a reservation for 7:30 on a Sunday night although when we got there we probably wouldn't have even needed it.  They were able to seat us outside which was just lovely.  The ambiance of the inside was very comfortable looking as well so I think we would have been happy no matter where we sat.  My dad ordered the Kale Caesar Salad and my mom and I ordered the shaved brussels sprout salad.  Both were delicious! The Brussels Sprout Salad was a good size to split to save room for dinner.  For dinner I ordered the Crispy Gnocci which was DELICIOUS. It was also such a great portion size, so I was able to finish it and still have room for dessert! My mom and dad were also very pleased with their Cavatelli and Spaghetti Stracchino.  For dessert we ordered the angels food cake and nutella french toast bread pudding, not a crumb left of either.  Between all that, a bottle of wine, and two beers our total was only $140 so we were pleasantly surprised by that! The staff were all very nice and our waiter was very helpful offering opinions on dishes when we asked so it was a very enjoyable evening! I highly recommend trying this place if you're in the neighborhood looking for a casual dinner spot for a reasonable price!"," enjoy Both were delicious The ambiance of the inside was very comfortable looking as well so I think we would have been happy no matter where we sat.

"A bit of a disappointment after reading so many great things about Gastroteca. Came here one night for dinner, and the meal started off great with well crafted cocktails. However, the dishes we ordered were ok, but nothing to write home about. The ""crispy"" gnocchi seemed more like an excuse to describe the pasta as ""overdone."" The pistachio pesto served with it was tasty, but in this foodie era of trying to be different, ""crispy"" fell short of any worthy accolades. The crostini had good flavor combinations but again, read more like burnt toast. The decor was nice, and the staff charming, but I don't think we will be returning for dinner. From what I've read, I believe brunch is moreso in this restaurant's wheel house, so I will be back to give it another try!"," A bit of a disappointment after reading so many great things about Gastroteca.

"We stumbled on Gastroteca on a whim due to other Yelp reviews! And we don't regret it. The exterior of the restaurant needs a sign for newcomers though. Upon arriving, we were seated at a table for two right away. The waiter came by asking for water preferences and drinks. We had tap water with a glass of orange juice. The juice was so fresh.Our entrees consisted of steaks and eggs and the crispy gnocchi. The steak was medium and the eggs were well done sprinkled with Italian seasoning Which was an interesting mix up! The fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, absolutely perfect. As for the spinach salad it was dressed lightly. No complaints.The crispy gnocchi was not as crispy as I wished. They were a little soft and mushy. The gnocchi was dressed in a pesto cheese sauce that was great and topped with more cheese. Who doesn't love cheese? But delicious nonetheless. If the portion was smaller it would serve as a great appetizer. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to my friends and I will definitely be back to try the grits and carbonara."," The juice was so fresh.Our entrees consisted of steaks and eggs and the crispy gnocchi.

"There are so many reviews here for brunch but their dinner menu was fantastic. Gastroteca is probably a great place to bring dates or friends - the restaurant itself is beautiful with walls of glass facing the street on two sides, simple chandeliers, and cosy seating. When I went there was no wait, and they were screening old movies (no sound) on the wall over the bar. Let's just start by saying that the service was definitely 5 star worthy - everyone was so nice and helpful. We ordered the housemade baked mozzarella, the Atlantic salmon (with clam sauce), and also ravioli de zucca and spicy cavatelli with clams. The salmon was a p.e.r.f.e.c.tly cooked medium like we asked with a crackly crust, and my friend wouldn't share her ravioli because it was apparently that good. Next time we'll definitely try the crispy gnocchi appetizer. It was used as a garnish on the salmon and it was really good!"," There are so many reviews here for brunch but their dinner menu was fantastic.

"I came here for brunch for Mother's Day. There were a lot of empty tables that were supposedly reserved, but no one ever got seated the entire hour that we were around. We ended up sitting at the bar because we were short on time and it ended up being great because the bartender was super attentive and friendly, offering us coffee right away and refills constantlyWe started with the meatballs; they were super moist and just over all delicious. The only thing was that no one ever gave us plates, so we had to use our hands and some sauce got on the bar. My mom got the vegetarian benedict, while my brother got the lamb hash benedict and both thought each one was really yummy. They especially liked the home fries that came with the dish. I got the brunch lasagna, which was also delicious, but the bottom lasagna layer was very tough... Not sure why, but the inside was the important part and who's complaining with losing a layer of carbs? TLDR; Great brunch place; might want to make reservations."," We ended up sitting at the bar because we were short on time and it ended up being great because the bartender was super attentive and friendly, offering us coffee right away and refills constantlyWe started with the meatballs; they were super moist and just over all delicious.

The server seated us in one section and hung out, out of sight which made it difficult for us to wave him down when we needed water refills or napkins or our check. The food overall was beautifully presented but the flavors were lacking. The eggs benedict tasted like ""a big egg mcmuffin"" in the words of my sister.

"Thank you Gastroteca and waiter for making me enjoy such a wonderful brunch meal with my love. Im really grateful that a delicious and classy brunch place like this is open on weekdays as well! I had a great meal! I ordered a Atlantic salmon crostino and a side of home fries: the ricotta matches the salmon real well topped with a runny eggs. Loves the home fries because they were a perfect side.3 for $10 Crostino mix: prosciutto kind, salumi with brie and roasted red pepper fontina. LOVED IT! Depending on your taste the salumi was super flavorful while the red pepper was a delight and hearty.Lastly ordered the rigatoni carbonara! Carbonara is really hard to find in the US made correctly.

"What I liked about this place was that it was cute. But other than that I would not go back. I went here after work one day with my two coworkers to get an early dinner & drinks. We were the only ones inside at about 3:30 in the afternoon. Upon entering I smelled mop cleaner throughout the place. That bothered me. We were told we could sit anywhere. I liked the set up of the place. It's very comfortable and quaint.I didn't care for the menu at all. It is very sparse. They have two sandwiches and one burger choice. A few brunch items and several pasta dishes that they claim all pasta is in house made. No bread basket brought out, no sangria on their menu.I ordered a chicken club sandwich. The bread was too hard. They had melted cheese on top of the top bread then places a wet pickle spear on top which wet the bread. There was supposed to be a garlic aioli on the sandwich but there was barely any. The avocado was turning brown. And there was maybe one or two very thin slices of chicken breast on the bottom. The prosciutto that it was supposed to have on it didn't taste good at all. It came with fries. Those were crispy and seasoned well. But not worth $12 at all.

"This review is solely on the service and not the food, as that was great.You would think that the service would be great, if not wonderful especially on a Sunday Afternoon, with no crowds and a call was placed in advance just incase we weren't able to get a seat, as it was a group of 6 people. The service was horrible! Which was funny because the week prior a friend and I went to Gastroteca and had a wonderful experience. This week thinking that the service would be just as great, we decided to bring friends/family...it was not. Our reservation was for 5:30pm and our group had arrived around 5:10pm. Thinking we would be able to sit down earlier than expected as we were a little early on time, but we were very wrong. None of the staff members, who were either on their phones, or eating, decided to assist in any way. Even after 2 individuals from the group approached the restaurant employee (on separate occasions) asking in regards to our table, both times we received an answer not suggesting that they would seat us. I am not sure what it was..maybe it was because we were a culturally different group of people or maybe because we had a child amongst us, but it wasn't until we noticed that other people were being seated other than us that we decided to go to another restaurant down the block. I thought the wonderful experience that I originally had going to Gastroteca would be a similar one today, I was truly disappointed that it was not. In all honesty, because of this experience, I would probably never go back here or recommend this establishment to any friend or family member that I know."," This review is solely on the service and not the food, as that was great.You would think that the service would be great, if not wonderful especially on a Sunday Afternoon, with no crowds and a call was placed in advance just incase we weren't able to get a seat, as it was a group of 6 people.

"Food was rather satisfying, and paired well. BUT, the service was absolutely horrendous. - Check out below for my reviews of various aspects of our brunch venture.FOOD (4/5): - It was hit or miss for my family, but I enjoyed 3/4 dishes we had. I had the chicken and waffles, my mom the Shrimp and Grits, sister had the Nutella French Toast, and my grandmother the Lamb Hash. The name of the game here is simplicity. The chef paired flavors very well together, and executed. There were some issues though. A glaring one was that there was virtually no grits in the Shrimp & GRITS dish. They seemed to serve polenta instead, and it was the one under-executed aspect. The grits, sorry, polenta was so soft it could have been mistaken for a sauce. Besides the polenta mixup, I believe the food was notable overall.SERVICE - Terrible. Perhaps it was the server we had, but I felt like such a stranger. Our server wasn't rude by any means, and our food was brought out on time. The issue wasn't with what happened, but rather what did not happen.First off, I never felt or server was pleasant. I think he smiled once, maybe. But, whatever no need to smile, that's cool. My issue is that once he took our orders he never came back. Our waters were never refilled, we were never checked up on, etc. As a matter of fact, he never looked our way; I know b/c I was trying to get his attention to ask for some hot sauce. The only time I got his attention was when I had to say ""excuse me, may we have the check"".Now please don't take me for being pretentious or stuck up. I would like to think that I'm very down to Earth, and try to be as forgiving as possible. I, however, really felt neglected in this restaurant as if we did something wrong. Apologies if we did something wrong, but I honestly don't believe we did (I noticed this server treating others the same way). DECOR- Pretty trendy. It was a quaint environment... sort of felt like we were in a nice loft. It was fun to watch the movies being played on the wall near the bar. The music was fun as well, but I some may not like it (I liked it a lot).OVERALL- Food was good, and I can't really complain. Hopefully the service issue was a one time thing b/c I'm definitely interested in revisiting this joint. I feel it has a lot of potential (compliments to the chef), and am interested in seeing what a dinner menu has to offer!** Apologies for the lack of pictures.

"I'm so bad. I've only been to brunch in Astoria a few times. Slowly making my way around the area and that's when I stumbled upon Gastroteca. Seeing very positive reviews for both brunch and dinner, I figured I'd check it out! What first caught my eye were the prices - super reasonable. They have a decent amount of options for brunch (no boozy specials, sorry) so it was definitely hard to pick. Luckily I went with Winnie and she graciously agreed to splitting entrees. We ordered their usual on the menu item, the Shrimp Scampi and Grits. It had sausage, tomato, pepper over polenta and a fried egg. The sauce was a tad bit tangy and went perfectly with the smooth creamy polenta base. I really enjoyed the dish, it was rich but not too filling. Also, the shrimp were cooked well.We also ordered the special: the Chicken and Waffles - they were crusted with a cornmeal coating and topped with a maple honey butter. DAMN, this was good. The chicken was crispy yet tender and the maple butter was an especially nice touch. I would definitely order this again. It was a nice portion too.Aside the food, I really enjoyed the atmosphere as well. Although Gastroteca emits more of a gothic vibe with the black and red decorations - the place is airy, spacious and I love those big bright floor-to-ceiling windows. Can't wait to come back for dinner time. Looking forward to it."," enjoy Seeing very positive reviews for both brunch and dinner, I figured I'd check it out!

Really liked the old film projected in the brick wall behind the bar.Food: veal meatballs were tender and tasty but sauce was underseasoned. Bread to go with sauce was garlicky but i didn't like that one end of it was already dipped into the sauce plate because it got a little soggy. Complimentary bread basket and olive oil was really good! I don't know why it came out after our appetizers were brought to us since it was cold bread anyway... not like it was being newly prepared in the back. Entrees were spaghetti carbonara and gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce. Carbonara was good, but tasted a little like chicken bullion powder. Pasta was cooked well. Less fatty and creamy than other versions i've had but i actually liked that. The gnocchi was dense and gluey, sauce was good for first few bites but since it was very creamy, i had trouble finishing portion even though it was not that big. Dessert was warm chocolate cake and gelato. Pretty standard but tasted good. Pricing was very reasonable and a big reason why i would return."," Love the look of the bar Bread to go with sauce was garlicky but i didn't like that one end of it was already dipped into the sauce plate because it got a little soggy.

"Gastroteca is a very airy gem in the residential areas of Long Island City, perhaps bordering on Astoria?  I love their high ceilings, tall windows, outdoor seating, and decor. Our waitress was very enthusiastic and knowledgable of the menu.  My friends and I all had their smoked salmon crostino, which is an Italian variation of the classic brunch Norwegian Benedict. While the salmon was fresh, the egg perfectly half runny, crostino toasted to excellence, I still prefer the classic on English muffins. I also highly recommend their mango juice. Drink it before the ice melts because it has the perfect consistency right when it's prepared. I didn't like their iced coffee so don't come here for good coffee. Dessert, we tried Panna cotta and tiramisu. I would skip the former and dig in the latter, yum!  Best tiramisu I have had in Queens!Bonus 10% off bill when you check in on Yelp!  It was honored no problem."," Gastroteca is a very airy gem in the residential areas of Long Island City, perhaps bordering on Astoria?

"Very sad to write this review but the service was TERRIBLE. Took about an hour from when we sat down to get our ""table food"". Thankfully the food was good so the wait for the next 25 minutes for our entrees was worth it. Sitting outside and having to go inside because we are weren't offered a refill of our water is not the way to go. And to say that there were large parties inside yes I do see that. I also saw a ""large party"" of two who sat down 30-35 minutes after us. Sit. Eat. Get their check before we even got our entree. All and all I can't imagine the service to be that bad on a daily basis especially after lookin at at other reviews however very disappointing to say the least.", Very sad to write this review but the service was TERRIBLE.

"I great spot to have Friday brunch. Its corner location provides plenty of natural lighting that makes the place stand out. Although we had one waitress when our party was there, she was very attentive to everyone. The brunch menu was priced moderately. In addition, they had a very excellent brunch cocktail menu. I highly recommend the Freddy Kruger bloody Mary; it is a blood Mary with the addition of jalapeno infused vodka which gives it an extra kick and will wake you up right away. Great place to bring a date or a small group of friends!"," I great spot to have Friday brunch Although we had one waitress when our party was there, she was very attentive to everyone.

"I'll take my parents here when they visit NYC.My reservations were happily greeted despite arriving a few minutes late.Talk about finding a golden egg, here's my experience.My date and I opened with Kale Caesar Salad. It was perfectly dressed in homemade mediterranean caesar; it shined well on the ripe kale. The oils, seasonings, and cheese, blending perfectly with white anchovie paste. The salad was on par to what I've had in $$$$ steak houses.It was topped with sugar-cube-sized croutons and bacon lardons. A dish to remember that prepared us for the entree.The entree was presented open faced to my date with thumb out of the plate- something you see at a 5 star restaurant.Again, the service and style was impeccable.Entrée being roasted rosemary chicken on a bed of potatoes mash surrounded by a lovely moat of gravy. Topped with a duo of de-skined roast plum tomatos.Each bite was worth every chew.If I had one request as a chicken going to slaughter, I would ask for this to be my fate.Desert was presented in the same method, respecting my girlfriend.A coconut panna cotta spired with a golf ball mango sorbet and pineapple chutney, sitting in a shallow layer of guava soup.If Gilligan and his crew had this coconut dish, the whole squad wouldn't have left the island.After our meal, Chef John the owner himself, came out to greet us and thank us for our patronage. Did they think we were critics from michilen, NY times...?This was a very special service that I will not forget. Unbelievably awesome in pretty much everyway.An unforgettable meal, excellent service, and adorable atmosphere. I really hope this place is as good on super busy nights.I was sad it was over, but happy that it happened."," I'll take my parents here when they visit NYC.My reservations were happily greeted despite arriving a few minutes late.Talk about finding a golden egg, here's my experience.My date and I opened with Kale Caesar Salad.

"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner to celebrate our anniversary since our first date was brunch here a year ago. How disappointing! I don't blame the servers, who kept apologizing. But the food was SO slow to come out. We sat there for almost 30 minutes before being offered bread for the table. We ordered the fig jam, ricotta, and prosciutto crostini, the Brussels sprouts as an appetizer, the risotto with sweet sausage and kale, and the salmon. The server described the Brussels sprouts as ""sautéed with bacon and garlic"" but when they came out they were limp, tasteless, and late! No sign of any bacon or garlic -- it tasted like they were just steamed with some salt and olive oil. The crostini was delicious but maybe we were just ravenous. Finally! The entrees! The portions were way smaller than expected. My risotto was more watery than creamy, and the beans dominated the taste. The salmon was kind of bland, but the sauce and corn did spice it up a little. We  definitely left here hungry. All in all, 100% not worth it. I won't be coming back here, for brunch or dinner. I recommend Cafe Bar down the street."," My boyfriend and I came here for dinner to celebrate our anniversary since our first date was brunch here a year ago. But the food was SO slow to come out.

"One of the few brunch spots that I actually really enjoyed coming to. Gastroteca was one of the places I considered throwing my friend's Bridal Shower. It wasn't our final choice, but I was glad i was able to try out their brunch menu yesterday. All I have to say was...WOW...that Chicken and Waffle was amazing and it was definitely the best I've ever had! The waffle was fluffy, their maple syrup and butter was addictive, and the chicken was perfectly crispy. The scampi & grits was an interesting combo too. It had a mixture of shrimps, sausage, tomato, peppers, over a bed of polenta and a fried egg. The simplicity of the polenta really brought out the flavor of the meat sauce. Service was amazing and rumor has it that their coffee is amazing. Also, love the spacing and the serenity of the place."," enjoy It wasn't our final choice, but I was glad i was able to try out their brunch menu yesterday.

Decor was so cute!! I love the bar. Next time I'll sit there and get wine poured by the cute guy. Promise. Went with two friends who both thoroughly enjoyed dining here as well. Waitress (two) were very attentive and never let our cups go dry. Plenty of water and wine. I ordered the branzino and swapped the sauce/pancetta for garlic mashed potatoes. Awesome choice.

"Cool place to go and meet friends. Very spacious. Has seating inside and out. The food is average, but expensive. I went with my friends for brunch. I ordered a spinach and goat cheese omelette with home fries and bacon on the side. The omelette and home fries was $11. The bacon on the side was $4. I did not enjoy the bacon, it was over cooked; it was like eating a hard potato chip.We also had a zeppole for the table which is a fried dough dessert. It tasted good."," enjoy Cool place to go and meet friends Has seating inside and out The food is average, but expensive."
"This is probably among my top 5 brunch spots in astoria - and if you're from astoria, you know there are several brunch spots on every corner. Half of the restaurant is outdoor seating and even if you sit indoors, the ceilings are really high and the glass doors next to the area are always open, giving the entire restaurant a nice airy feel. Perfect for enjoying the breezy, sunny spring mornings. I know some people who go to Brunch to have an excuse for drinking before 3pm but the food here was really good! I got a chicken&waffles and my friend got a charles benedict - totally iconic brunch staples that Gastroteca did well on. I would have liked better customer service since it we pretty much seated ourselves and didn't get addressed until 15 minutes later, but ultimately the decor, customer service, environment comes second to the food - which was spot on."," enjoy Half of the restaurant is outdoor seating and even if you sit indoors, the ceilings are really high and the glass doors next to the area are always open, giving the entire restaurant a nice airy feel.

"Came here for brunch on a Saturday and was quickly seated. The seating by the windows is a bit cramped; the person behind me kept bumping her chair against mine.

"Came here on a Thursday afternoon for brunch. The waitress was really attentive and friendly. We ordered two orange juice to start off with. Maybe it was us but the orange juice tasted different.. couldn't put our finger on it, I think they mixed it with the San pellegrino soda... nevertheless, a good different though. We ordered the crispy gnocchi and brunch lasagna with a side of home fries. This was my first time seeing brunch lasagna on the menu so I had to order that and it did not disappoint. It had sausage, bacon, spinach and topped off with an egg. It was delicious. The crispy gnocchi was delicious as well, we really enjoyed the sauce it came in. However, this place was really pricey especially for the portion size.

I order the chicken and waffles. It was really good. My girlfriend ordered eggs benedict and turkey bacon. She really enjoyed her meal as well. So here's why I took away some stars.....the dessert!!!! We ordered the zeppoles. They looked and smelled amazing. However, when I cut into the first one.....the inside was completely raw. We told our waiter and he was apologetic; he put in for a new batch. Our first order of zeppoles had sugar/cinnamon with powdered sugar. The second batch only had powdered sugar. They were so PLAIN, tasted like nothing! It was pretty unpleasant. The zeppoles came with a little chocolate dip on the side but that didn't even help give some flavor.

Everything was good, from soup to nuts.We started with oysters and tuna crudo, a very tasty prelude to the main events. Competently mixed drinks were flowing.For me the standouts were creamy polenta, veal meatballs, balsamic glazed lamb ribs, and the arancini (mushroom, truffle, and stracchino).

The waitstaff is extremely friendly, and the place was busy enough that you felt like you were at a happening place without feeling claustrophobic.Sesame Street was being played on the projector, which is actually an amazing thing to watch when you're a few Bloody Mary's deep.

"I don't think I have ever had a bad meal or drink here (although the red sangria was a bit too strong/brandy tasting). The MM MM mimosa is my fave! Been here for brunch on more than one occasion and was never disappointed. Sometimes it gets a little busy but I mean, it's a sweet spot so who cares? As long as the mimosas keep coming, you stop paying attention to something as pesky as time right? The zeppoles/donuts are a MUST- they're to die for.

"This place is so adorable and obviously has potential. I came mid afternoon on a Monday so business was practically non existent and the service was therefore slow. I overlooked this factor since the server was nice and I've been in the industry for a long time so I understand how it is. Having said that, the one thing I cannot get over is the fact that various members of the staff including management openly commented about the bad tip that the recently vacated table had just left. Since I was the only guest left in the restaurant, I could clearly hear every word. The first thing that I was taught working in the service industry is to NEVER discuss other patrons in the earshot of guests. Besides this faux pas incident, the food was beautifully presented but needed more flavour. I'm willing to give this establishment a few more chances on different days and times but I'll never forget this first awkward experience..."," This place is so adorable and obviously has potential.

The restaurant is spacious and beautiful. The server was nice and attentive. The only problem is that I got food poisoning. I ordered the salmon and the server recommended to have it served medium rare which is fine. The dish tasted fine even though the center was almost like a sashimi texture.

"I can only review my experience visiting this spot one time on a Thurs night. Eh. I ordered the tagliata (steak) and it wasn't good. A poor cut of meat, tough with gristle. It's always touchy to send something back and it would've kept me in the restaurant longer than I wanted. My view is that steak should never have gotten to the table in the first place.

I got the California Benedict with a side of home fries, both were simply delicious. One of my friends got the Polenta, which was very filling.

While my lasagna bolognese was tasty, service was very slow and I thought my waiter had forgotten me. Admittedly I was sitting outside, but my waitress did not come out to check that I had been served. I also ordered a coke which tasted more like diet coke and then I had to remind the waitress that I needed some bread. So all in all not a great experience from a service perspective.

However, one thing that kind of annoyed me was that every table got served bread with butter where our table didn't get bread.

Came with a party of five for lunch during the week. Two of us loved our entree and the others were not crazy about it. I had the pesto cavatelli and my friend had the blue crab spaghettini. Ours came out al dente and amazing but for the folks who ordered the linguine with clams the consensus was it was super salty. When they told the waiter he took it back and didn't offer any apologies or offer to make them something else but only saw it taken off on the bill.

Honestly this place was beyond mediocre. Which was especially disappointing because of its 4 star status and fairly good reviews. Definitely unworthy of four stars regarding their brunch. So let's start from the beginning. We had a reservation for 1:00pm on Memorial Day. We got caught in some traffic and called to let them know we were en route however would be a little late to our reservation. The person on the phone was extremely rude and said they couldn't hold our table for much longer bc they had a lot of people waiting to be seated. We arrive and there were several open tables and literally no one waiting. So ...? We were celebrating a friends birthday so obv we opted for the mmm mmm mimosa carafe which had little to no alcohol at all. 98% juice. Unacceptable. Everyone's food was unmemorable and unexciting. I ordered the California eggs Benedict and it was the worst Benedict I've ever had. So so plain and bland and don't even get me started on the hollandaise. No flavor whatsoever. My friend had the fried chicken and waffles and said the same thing. Bland. Under seasoned etc. It was beyond disappointing. Eggs Benedict is a brunch staple and if you can't execute that right maybe you shouldn't have it on your menu. Definitely won't be returning., Honestly this place was beyond mediocre. Which was especially disappointing because of its 4 star status and fairly good reviews. Definitely unworthy of four stars regarding their brunch We got caught in some traffic and called to let them know we were en route however would be a little late to our reservation The person on the phone was extremely rude and said they couldn't hold our table for much longer bc they had a lot of people waiting to be seated. We arrive and there were several open tables and literally no one waiting. Everyone's food was unmemorable and unexciting. No flavor whatsoever Under seasoned etc Eggs Benedict is a brunch staple and if you can't execute that right maybe you shouldn't have it on your menu.
"First, let me start by saying we loved this place when the new ownership took it  over from Locale. Most of the lovely servers from the old guard stayed on, and the ingredients and menu improved, the new owners were there often and attentive and friendly. And there weren't odd rules about reservations or waiting for a table. Lately this place is just ridiculous. We've lived in the neighborhood since before it opened and have always been satisfied regular patrons. But now ANY time we try to go, the extremely RUDE host/manager (guy with dark hair and glasses) is guarding the door and snarkily asks how many, then we tell him. Then he basically says something along the lines of ""reservation, right?"" (when more than half of the tables appear open) and if we say no he just tosses the menus away and shoots a glare as if we are peons that he can't help. If we ask how long it might be to wait otherwise he rolls his eyes and points at the bar as if it is a dentention center and tells us it's an option. Then turns on his heel and dismisses us. SERIOUSLY. It is SO disappointing. Everyone here was always so nice and there was never a reservations only policy. If we go now, we make a point to drop in when that guy isn't running the door because it feels like a kick in the gut every time. I've worked in bars and restaurants for many years. This table nazi stuff is such a turn off. Be gracious and sympathetic about it at least if you seriously are so piled up with reservations that there's no way in for a decade. Which come on, I highly doubt is always the case. This isn't the Four Seasons here. This new level of pretentiousness is truly befuddling at this point in the game. This is a neighborhood restaurant.Anyways, still lovers of the food and service otherwise, we went ahead and made a reservation this week. Greeted by the same rude as ever staffer (maybe manager? hard to tell...) again, we say yup, reservation this time (the place was packed as it was Saturday night, so made sense this time) and the only tables open are one right by the door in the middle of the room and two others up in the elevated section. He shows us the worst table (so much for the privilege of making a reservation) and when we ask if we can sit up in the other section he says it's for larger parties. Can't win. So we settle otherwise for the high top bar tables (aka- see above: detention center for folks made to feel dumb for not making a reservation).Fine. The service was great at first, waitress was lovely and friendly and attentive. We ordered. Then a group of people (not a larger party than us) are led to a table we had previously requested and were denied. We wait, and wait, and wait for our food. Nobody coming by to see if we need... um... food we ordered. But meanwhile several items (including menu items that were in our order) are promptly delivered to the table seated after us. Host dude hovering over them, etc...Look, I get it. I've served friends and VIPs at restaurants too. But try not to make it so obvious that service at other tables suffer as a result. Especially when in plain view. So we wait. Then we ask a very helpful server (not ours, couldn't find her) if the food is coming, she helps, some food comes, other server and good service kick back in again- all great. We finish, plates are slowly cleared. Then nothing.No offer for additional drinks or dessert (they always do here)... No check drop. Nothing. Server is MIA... We turtle neck around the place for about 20 minutes as the host rushes around avoiding eye contact... finally one of us catches him and he drops the check. What's the deal here? Legit annoyed at the recent changes here. We're loyal, friendly, easy to please, well tipping customers. But seems like a tone is being set- mainly by door guy host manager fella that is just setting up each experience for failure. Ever meet someone who you knew was just looking for a fight? Yeah. Like that. Meanwhile, we had brunch at a nearby French place on 36th Ave earlier in the day and even in tightly packed quarters with rapidly demanded orders and a BARELY there mess up with a menu item mixed up that took about 20 seconds to correct, and one chef making allll of the orders, the hostess and server were highly attentive, greeted us with friendly attitudes, let us WAIT for a table to open up, and comped some brunch drinks to make up for the slight wait on the item mix up. So now I'm off to write them a glowing 5 star yelp review.UPDATE: Restaurant manager (host referenced above) wrote back a private message defending himself. Apologetic yet unsurprisingly abrasive- Did not address service issues. Not going back, will speak to the owner."," And there weren't odd rules about reservations or waiting for a table.

"Came here on labor day for brunch. There were seating   available outside, but since it was humid I rather stay in. The waitress took our order and it took forever for the food to come out. She said the kitchen was backed up, but it wasn't like all the tables were occupied. I got myself the California benedict, because everyone on yelp seems to be getting that. Upon arrival the dish just look sad. I understand that getting a benedict is not a big dish, but at least give me some more home fries. By the way I thought the home fries had more flavor than the California benedict.The only thing I would say that is good about this place is the decor, and their toast with nutella which was delicious."," Came here on labor day for brunch I understand that getting a benedict is not a big dish, but at least give me some more home fries.

"I promised to write a review for this place before Steph gets an opportunity to go here. I came here last night with a friend after we realized we were both starving to death. He frequently comes in for brunch which he said was pretty good. It's not the boozey I'm going to get you crunked under the table style brunch but they have delicious rustic Italian foods with a modern twist that they claim all endorse fresh ingredients found locally in Astoria. For dinner we split the appetizer trio of bruschetta ($10): Fig Jam, Ricotta, and Prosciutto - Kind of a standard toast spread, it was tasty but not the best of the bunch. Stracchino, garlic, mushrooms - My personal favorite and definitely the most flavored with a rich thick soft cow's cheese. Sicilian Pineapple, mascarpone, chili flakes - Absolutely nothing was wrong with this. It was sweet and spicy and pretty much perfection. For my entrée I ended up going with the Crispy Gnocchi ($16): Pistachio pesto, spinach, and a liberal amount of shredded ricotta salata adorned on top. The dish was flavorful and I enjoyed the crispy exterior of the gnocchi which you don't typically find. The pastas definitely tasted hand made. Portions I will say for $15-20 dishes are pretty small as hell. While it was personally filling for me because of the density of the pasta and the richness I still usually expect more bang for your buck. This is Astoria after all. He ordered the Linguini Limone ($14): Accompanied with ramps and 4 cloves of garlic. I swear I tasted bacon and eggs in this but maybe I'm just crazy. It was sinfully decadent and very similar to a carbonara with extra lemon and garlic. Again, small portions - heavy dish. Service was pretty fast and excellent so I am not sure what all the other yelpers are complaining about. Though, the restaurant was pretty empty when I attended. Don't forget to use your 10% off coupon through Yelp because I totally did but I'd be willing to give the restaurant another shot, pats Yelp app lovingly."," enjoy I came here last night with a friend after we realized we were both starving to death.

"I went here for brunch with my sister on Sunday August 30th. I had the waffle with caramel sauce and an almond based whipped cream. It was so delicious and my two year old niece approved! I just wish that it would have come with eggs I had to order them separately which whopped up my food cost to 16 bux. The decor of the place is beautiful and I'm interested to see what dinner is like although I have seen the menu to know it is more on the pricey side. There are better brunch deals pricewise in Astoria. My sister had a chicken club sandwich that was dry and had slightly burnt toast. She wishes she would have gotten the California eggs benedict she had been debating over, the people next to us had them and they looked so tasty. Would definitely come back since it is such an overall nice spot and service was relatively good."," Would definitely come back It was so delicious and my two year old niece approved!

"My boyfriend and I went to Gastroteca for brunch Sunday morning. The food was excellent, but there were a couple definite issues we had with our experience. First let me start by telling you, the place isn't that big - no more than 20 inside tables and 10 stools at the bar. When we arrived around 1:15, 5 4-seat tables were reserved for a large party showing up at 1:30. We ultimately sat outside, but at the same time as the large party. Our server seemed to be the odd man out, because the other tables were being attended to but our waiter took forever to come over to us and take our order. Then we waited for about 30 minutes to get the check. Not ideal to have that many tables blocked off and have slow service, but everyone has those busy times so I get it. It doesn't take away from the fact that the food was delicious. I had the scampi and grits, which was amazing. The combination seems weird but it's super tasty and the perfect amount of food. Sunny side up eggs were perfectly cooked and the dish had just enough heat. My boyfriend had the italian benedict and enjoyed it a lot as well. We split the banana ricotta zepoles which was probably too much food but they were delicious as well. Bottom line - great food, iffy service (at least that afternoon), and make a reservation if you're going at a busy time."," enjoy Not ideal to have that many tables blocked off and have slow service, but everyone has those busy times so I get it.

Really reliable quality of food and service. I have been here with large groups and just for date night and their service and food is consistent. We always over-order because there are so many great options on the menu. Great decor. They play classic movies in the background which is a fun distraction.  I forgot my food at the bar and one of the staff ran a block after me and my wife. I've been a bunch of times and never left disappointed. I definitely recommend the lamb ribs and the branzino., I have been here with large groups and just for date night and their service and food is consistent.

Went here for brunch yesterday and the food was good and staff was friendly. I wasn't sure we could pull off a last minute brunch date for 6 people but we did without having to wait. They had disco music playing with the movie beetlejuice playing on a projector (for Halloween). My friends had a bus to catch so it was good that the food came quickly.

"This place exudes brunch. The atmosphere is great, the decor is homey, this place is a fantastic brunch spot. The outdoor seating on the 75 degree day I went was also a added bonus. On nice weather days, they open all the door/window things in front of their restaurant and it makes it look like a big open space. I have been twice and I have sat outside both times.  The food:Fried eggs with cheddar polenta & breakfast sausage. Holy Jesus did I enjoy this. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the sausage was homemade, it didn't have that supermarket feel to it. I am a big fan of polenta, add cheddar to it and I am sold. lol  Only issue I had was the noticeably greasy whole wheat toast. Weird. yelp.com/user_local_photPoached eggs, buttermilk biscuit and country gravy. The biscuits were just OK kinda dry though, the gravy was nice but this dish didn't have any meat. I was expecting the gravy to be a sausage gravy or something at least. The hash browns bugged me though, there were so greasy. They were more like fries than hash browns, they were crispy and had nice flavor but were super greasy. yelp.com/user_local_photCorned Beef Hash- The flavor of the hash was just so so, but the hash looks so unappealing. yelp.com/user_local_phot Locale Mojito- I really liked the Mojito, it was really nice and refreshing."," enjoy The atmosphere is great, the decor is homey, this place is a fantastic brunch spot.

"Went here for brunch with family during the week and ate some pretty good chicken and waffle. The waiter seemed to also be the hostess and chef but we didn't wait too long! Mom reported the burger was ""excellent"" which for the self-proclaimed ""Meat and Milk"" woman is a GLOWING review of this place. I want to go back for some nighttime drinks since the illuminated wall from the projected movie gives it a cool vibe.",
"Walked past it and decided to check it out for Saturday brunch. Went in without a reservation and got seated right away.  The service was excellent, our server was very friendly and attentive. The selection was pretty good, we went with the eggs benedict and the potatoes. The eggs were cooked properly, I just wish the hollandaise sauce was a bit more flavorful as I thought it was a little on the bland side.

"Never had a bad experience here, however, today's experience was based on seating. I was seated in the lower tables next to the upper level. The food was good and ambience was chill until I got a whiff of stinky feet. That's when I saw that the person's sitting on the top level's feet was next to my food.

"Had a really great early dinner here last weekend.  We came here for the burger, but were too late for the brunch menu so we ordered dinner instead.  The food, service, and setting were all really great.We ordered the calamari appetizer which tasted fresh and was well cooked, but not anything special.  Still it was a good sized order for the price.  Next time we'll try the arancini.  I had the zuca ravioli in brown butter leek sauce, which was suggested by the server. It was a nice portion of homemade ravioli, a great fall dish.  My boyfriend had the fettucini and lamb sausage, which he could not get enough of.  We LOVED the bread with olive oil before the meal as well (could've eaten just that and have been happy!)  For drinks my boyfriend had a pumpkin based cocktail and the bold fashioned, both of which were really delicious and unique.  I had a drink with gin, cucumber, dill, and olive brine which was absolutely amazing.  Like nothing I've ever had before. The waiter was extremely attentive, and took the time to answer all our questions and to walk me through the Italian wines on the menu as we ate at an off time and he had few other customers.  He comped us one of the drinks when it took a long time to arrive at our table too! The place is beautiful with huge glass windows, lots of white tile and marble, and painted tin ceilings.  They were playing classic movies on the tv and playing 40's and 50's songs over the loudspeaker.  It's a great place for a date or special occasion.  Definitely going to return!"," Had a really great early dinner here last weekend.

"The ambiance is cute but I probably won't come back. I have been to most of the brunch spots in Astoria and none have wowed me so we decided to try gastroteca. The space is nice, bright, and open and they play movies against the brick wall behind the bar which is cool. Plus side: you can call ahead and we got seated immediately. Biggest turn off is waiting an hour for brunch when you're already hangry. The food is forgettable. I got the California Benedict which was satisfactory- not bad but not great. The poached eggs were a little watery and the dish itself was way under seasoned. I got the side of home fries which were greasy. Fiancé got steak and eggs which were salty and the salad had a LOT of vinegar. Overall, meh."," The ambiance is cute but I probably won't come back.

"I've come here for dinner on a few occasions (always with a reservation) and the food is always good. Our frequent server, Anna, makes great recommendations on wine and food. Last visit we had the salmon and horseradish risotto and it was the best dish I've had there. The salmon is cooked rare and is delicious. The risotto was flavored perfectly (warning, there are peas in it, in case you're not a fan, BUT the people at my table who don't like peas still enjoyed it!). Seriously, we didn't want this dish to end! It was just a special the night we went, but we hope it makes it into the regular menu! *hint hint*The crostini apps are always a treat, highly recommend trying the 3 for $10 deal. The kale caesar salad is an unexpected jem, with crutons and bacon tossed in. Organic Montepulciano from their wine list is also highly recommended.", enjoy I've come here for dinner on a few occasions (always with a reservation) and the food is always good.

"I've had this place bookmarked for awhile now so when after-movie plans fell through, we set out to find another place to eat at and Locale came up.I worry most of the time when my 9-yo babe come to dinner with us at a dimly lit restaurant. She is behave enough to take but not truly old enough to witness any debauchery that might go on lol. Locale may be dimly lit, offer different kinds of alcoholic beverages and give off that ""adult only"" vibe but it was most definitely kid friendly. As soon as we came in, our server (super bubbly and friendly), gave us our seating options. Of course we have to take the booth like corner up the few steps. ""Whatever the princess wants"" :).

Long bar height communal table in the middle. Conducive for a romantic first date dinner that won't break your bank and can seriously get you brownie points. Their menu wasn't massive. Crostinos, Antipasti, Pasta and Second Course - Main. Probably have about 6 items per section. We chose three crostinis - goat cheese and beet was on their special, burrata with hummus and artichoke and flash fried calamari with chillies for appetizers. For our main, we shared their Gnocchi and Taglaitelle Bolognese.Crostinis were tasty. It was 3 for $10. Burrata was the best one. Fried calamari was cooked perfect. Not chewy or overcooked at all. The marinara sauce that came with it had a little kick to it but it was a good kind of kick. Their pastas were awesome. All of them were freshly made according to the menu. Meat sauce in the Bolognese was spot on. And Gnocchi with some mushrooms and truffle was creamy and tasty as well.We were offered free dessert. Actually, they offered it to my 9-yo but when the wait staff mentioned dark chocolate Flourless cake, I had to exclaim ""yes!"". Oh, I'm sorry. Thought you were talking to me lol. She did choose the cake. It was a bit overcooked giving it a little crunch but I loved it. And my babe loved it as well.Overall, a resounding 5 stars for great service and good food.

First and last time for brunch here. Ordered eggs well done came back soft. The drinks are extra cost to the menu and were lousy. Not really sure what people are thinking when they come here to eat. The water is from the sink then poured into different glass bottles. Someone said the water was the best lol you can get that at the hydrant on the corner for free.

This restaurant is very charming - a very inviting specious restaurant with a great bar. The waitstaff is very friendly and attentive as well.On a recent Visit we were very unhappy with our entrees. I had the rigatoni with eggplant which was very bland and barely had any flavor.  The pasta itself had no bite and just tasted off. The waitress realized something was off as we barely ate any of our food and after speaking to someone in charge comped us a $10 appetizer.

Astoria's hidden gem! Love the food & ambiance. Italian food is one of my favs and they sure delivered,
"The ambiance alone is the reason to try out this restaurant...Came for late night drinks and appetizers and was not disappointed. They were playing an old Audrey Hepburn movie in the back, there was quiet jazz playing and low lighting - perfect for a date night. I got the veal meatballs and the crostini deal (3 for $10)...so delicious! The cocktails were also to die for, I tried a Moscow mule and a roman holiday cocktail."," They were playing an old Audrey Hepburn movie in the back, there was quiet jazz playing and low lighting - perfect for a date night."

"My cousin did mention there were reviews about the slow service. It definitely held true tonight. 5:30 reservation for Mother's Day, we didn't receive our Crostini (3) and Antipasti until 6:50. Restaurant was not at full capacity, kitchen was apparently running behind.We ordered the following for primi piatti:-Fig jam, ricotta, prosciutto crostini-Stracchino, garlic, mushrooms crostini-Smoked salmon, zucchini pesto crostini-Shaved brussel sprouts, peppercorn dressing, hazelnut, pecorino (dressing and pecorino were non-existent)-Flash fried calamari, sicilian chiles (Hard to get wrong. What chiles?)The Crostinis were tasty, but throwing three slices of bread with toppings into an oven should not take 45+ minutes.Entrees:-3 orders of Tagliati, sliced ribeye, arugula radicchio salad, roasted potatoes. Ordered medium rare and two mediums, received medium well and two well dones. Returned the well done and got a new steak cooked medium. Don't understand how you can get the temperature wrong when the ribeye is sliced before serving! Retails $28-Two orders of Atlantic Salmon. One ordered medium rare, received well done.Decor: Small establishment with simple, modern decor. Windows allowing a lot of ambient light. Decent outdoor seating.Before leaving and after the slow service, we presented a Yelp coupon for 10% off. No fine print, but servers rejected because our party was larger than 4. Normally restaurants include promotion details with their offers.Verdict: Quality of food was acceptable, service and culinary abilities were subpar. Worth a visit if you're okay with lengthy meal and have good company to converse/drink with.

Windows allowing a lot of ambient light No fine print, but servers rejected because our party was larger than 4. Normally restaurants include promotion details with their offers.Verdict: Quality of food was acceptable, service and culinary abilities were subpar."
"Went here for brunch on a hot, hot Saturday and immediately noticed that it was still pretty warm inside the restaurant with mostly just the fans going. It wasn't crowded at all so it was easy to get a table. Our waitress seemed pretty rushed all the same and I had to ask for more water, etc. (which was also lukewarm...some ice would have been nice given that it was 90+ degrees out)Food was overall pretty bland. I got the shrimp and grits which was essentially some veggies/shrimp stewed in tomato sauce then poured over some polenta. It could have used more spices and seasonings. Others at our table got the chicken sandwich and fries. Chicken was apparently dry and fries were just okay and seemed like they were old and the last of the batch. Overall a disappointing meal, and I would not come again."," (which was also lukewarm...some ice would have been nice given that it was 90+ degrees out)Food was overall pretty bland.

"After the movies we decided to see what was around the way. Locale seemed like a nice spot so we headed in. We were sat at the corner table with a couch. The ambience was nice and comfortable. Light was dim, decor was classical yet artfully modern. The service here is remarkable. Everyone is happy. The servers and hosts aim to please. Multiple servers would ask how we were numerous times, gave us fresh shaved cheese, and a free dessert just because. Best service I've had in a while. As for the food, we had the flash fried calamari which was great. We ordered three crostinis, artichoke, burrata - best one and a special goat cheese and beet which was also good. For our entrees, we had the truffle gnocchi which was delicious and creamy. Love the shaved truffle. The tagliatelle bolognese was really fresh and good as well. They even gave us a free dessert of our choice. We went with the dark chocolate flour less cake. Would definitely come here again for the service and romantic chill vibe. People here are awesome."," We were sat at the corner table with a couch The ambience was nice and comfortable. Light was dim, decor was classical yet artfully modern. Everyone is happy.

We love this place! The homemade pasta is delicious and the service is great. If the weather is nice try and sit outside., The homemade pasta is delicious and the service is great. If the weather is nice try and sit outside.
"A real treat! From the service to the food, it was really excellent - great gf options!We live not too far and have been wanting to try it out for some time. When we arrived, we immediately loved the atmosphere - cozy, soft lighting and not too loud. We were seated right away and immediately greeted by Allison (hope I spelled that correctly). She was just the best. Attentive, knowledgeable, accommodating and really gracious. We ordered shaved Brussels sprouts to start - delicious. And for dinner, we had the Pollo Rosemary and Linguini with clams. Highlights included how tasty the chicken was. Often, chicken can get super dry but this was really great. Get this if you go there!I loved that I could easily sub gluten free penne in for the linguini and it was still super delicious. The sauce combo with the bacon and clams was really unique. I would go back in a heartbeat and try other things and take a few friends when they visit. Most of all, I'd say the #1 highlight was Allison. She was excellent."," A real treat From the service to the food, it was really excellent - great gf options!We live not too far and have been wanting to try it out for some time.

"Locale is a GREAT restaurant in Astoria, located slightly off the beaten path.  I hate to admit it but I forget about this restaurant sometimes (it is a little far from my apartment) which is why I've only eaten here 3 or 4 times. I brought my sister and brother-in-law here on Saturday night and they were definitely impressed with the quality of the food as well as the service.  Having lived in the West Village for close to 10 years they've eaten at some of the finest restaurants in NYC but they were more than satisfied with every delectable dish they tried here.  We started with several of the special crostinis to start, along with the veal meatballs.  After we devoured the appetizers, I enjoyed a tortellini and meat dish, and they ordered the pasta bolognese.  I'm pretty sure the menu changes often because I don't currently see what I ate on their online menu, nevertheless, anything you order here is going to be fresh and taste amazing (pasta is made fresh on site).Locale has an impressive wine and cocktail list and everything on the menu is reasonably priced.I believe our waitress's name was Anna (blonde hair) and she was absolutely fantastic!  She recited the night's specials to us from memory and was able to efficiently answer every question posed at her.  I will definitely recommend this restaurant to family and friends and I'll be back sooner rather than later.  Their brunch menu is something I'd love to check out as well!*** I think they recently changed their name because when I called for my reservation I missed what the hostess first said but she ended with ""formerly known as Locale."""," enjoy Locale is a GREAT restaurant in Astoria, located slightly off the beaten path.

"Great service and delicious food.  Stopped in for brunch on Sunday with a group of friends.I had the Chicken Club Sandwich with a side salad. Delicious and light, yet filling.  I love how they melted the cheese on top of the toasted bread.  Garlic aioli was flavorful and chicken was juicy.  I'm more of a savory brunch person, so I like the salt.. but I hate eggs. So this was a good choice for me.I tried my friend's french toast and it was one of the best ones I've had.  It was coated with cereal or something, super crunchy on the outside.. and fluffy on the inside. Topped with fresh berries and powdered sugar. Definitely have to come back and get that next time.Service was also wonderful and attentive.", Delicious Great service and delicious food Garlic aioli was flavorful and chicken was juicy.

I was here this past weekend with my girlfriend as we were exploring our new neighborhood and absolutely loved it!! The food and the drinks were Delicious!!! I love a great blood mary and this place definitely delivered on that. We ordered a burger and kale salad and some Zeppoles and nothing disappointed. The burger was nice and juicy and perfectly cooked. The Kale caesar salad came with bits of bacon (which i was not expecting.. always a great treat). The Zeppoles covered in that cinnamon sugar and sauce on the side was like the icing on the cake. Will definitely be back here soon!!, Delicious Will definitely be back Will definitely be back Will definitely be back The food and the drinks were Delicious!!!

Food is really bland. The shrimp or meatballs  made me and my friend sick. Never again., Food is really bland
Everything was made fresh and perfect for a Saturday brunch. Had the smoked salmon crostini and it was something I was worried if I'll like it with Runny eggs but everything paired so well and it filled me so well., Everything was made fresh and perfect for a Saturday brunch.

My boyfriend and I come here about three times a month for cocktails and dinner and have been regulars for over a year-- A testament to Gastroteca's consistency ! The baked gnocci with pesto is out of this world and they sure know how to make a stellar martini. Anna the waitress and Jeremy the bartender are fantastic and provide memorable service and dining experiences., Anna the waitress and Jeremy the bartender are fantastic and provide memorable service and dining experiences.
"Super cute place for brunch. Found myself in the Astoria, NY area this weekend, and needed brunch. Yelp came to the rescue as always. The staff are very accommodating. When my cousin disliked the dressing that came with her salad, the owner I believe went in the back and whipped her up another one to suit her taste.  Don't miss the breakfast potatoes! Delicious.", Delicious Super cute place for brunch
